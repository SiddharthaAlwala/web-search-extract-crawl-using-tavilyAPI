Today, Sharai Bohannon is sharing the top 10 horror televsion series of 2024.*\\n\\n2024 has been such a bizarre year for genre television. We have Billy Crystal leading a psychological thriller called ***[Before](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/516905/before-exclusive-clip-lies-and-ice-skating/#:~:text=While%20Billy%20Crystal%20may%20be,light%20after%20his%20wife's%20death.)***on Apple TV+. The streamer also just recently started airing my beloved ***[Silo](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/456687/stephen-king-just-cannot-wait-for-next-episode-of-mysterious-and-excellent-streaming-series/)***[’](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/456687/stephen-king-just-cannot-wait-for-next-episode-of-mysterious-and-excellent-streaming-series/)s second season. ***[Uzumaki](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/403699/uzumaki-junji-itos-horror-manga-is-becoming-a-beautiful-series/)*** landed on Max and introduced some of us heathens to the warped world of Junji Ito. Netflix also did that thing they’ve become known for and dropped a bunch of South Korean thrillers that deserve way more attention. If you’re still subscribed, please check out ***The Frog***, ***The Trunk***, ***A Killer Paradox***, and ***The Bequeathed*** because you’ll love at least one of them. We also saw the abrupt (and wrongful) cancellation of ***[Chucky](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/500766/jennifer-tilly-talks-those-chucky-season-3-shocks-and-surprises-video-interview/)*** instead of what should have been a guaranteed fourth season. Speaking of goodbyes, ***[What We Do In The Shadows](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/513963/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-final-season-is-funny-but-is-it-going-anywhere/)*** is in the middle of taking a bow as I write this list.\\n\\nAs a professional couch potato, this has been a lot of TV to keep up with. It’s also been some of the best distractions in these neverending “unprecedented times”. I have discovered a lot about myself while checking out what 2024 had to offer us serieswise. I learned I am more into the underseen ***Domino Day*** than the popular ***Agatha All Along.*** Stumbling upon ***My Undead Yokai Girlfriend***, ***Inspector Rishi,*** and ***Disclaimer*** served as reminders that sometimes sitting with a show before passing judgment is best. So, while I am about to rattle off the 10 best shows of the year, I encourage you to hit the apps. There’s so much buried treasure out there, and most of it deserves to be seen.\\n\\nAnyway, here are the titles that I think are the best horror shows of 2024.\\n\\n### 10. *Hysteria!* (Peacock)\\n\\nI was one of the many people who wrote this off as an attempt to cash in on the newest wave of Satan Panic horror caused by ***[Stranger Things’](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/430247/stranger-things-review-netflix-series-gets-to-its-nasty-horror-roots-with-dark-new-season/)*** latest season. However**, *[Hysteria!](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/514300/hysteria-review-bruce-campbells-new-show-makes-the-satanic-panic-fun/)*** turned out to be a very fun little binge in its own right. Benefiting from a fantastic performance by Julie Bowen and Bruce Campbell’s endless reservoir of coolness, this show took us on a chaotic ride. It also kept us guessing if anything satanic was really happening or if it was simply manifestations of our own fears until nearly the very end. So, while we’re having a good time watching teens get in trouble, we also have a very relevant conversation playing out. ***Hysteria!*** is the kind of predictable fun in period costumes that becomes a welcome palate cleanser between all of the darker fare we usually feast on.\\n\\n### 9. *Parasyte: The Grey* (Netflix)\\n\\nSouth Korea entered the chat with body-snatching gross goodness in 2024. This sci-fi horror mash-up has ***Invasion of the Body Snatchers*** and John Carpenter’s ***The Thing*** in its DNA. However, it quickly leans into wilder territory and something even more sinister as it becomes an addictive binge-watch. Based on the manga ***Parasyte*** by Hitoshi Iwaaki, ***[Parasyte: The Grey](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/500812/netflix-users-devour-top-charting-new-korean-horror-series-its-definitely-a-10-10/)*** is one of the itchiest, most paranoia-inducing shows of the year. In an era where alien invasions and live adaptations are struggling in the genre, it’s so cool to find a series that knocks it out of the park. This show is one of the reasons many of us are still talking to Netflix. Hopefully, the streamer greenlights a second season. We need more stories of lonely girls infected with mutant parasites learning it’s never too late to make friends. More tentacle-headed creatures battling would also be appreciated.\\n\\n### 8. *Evil*\\xa0(Paramount+)\\n\\nWhen ***Evil*** was good, it was very very good. While the show spent its time fighting against its broadcast TV beginnings, it maintained its whimsically unique vibe and gorgeous aesthetic. Supported by a strong supporting cast including Andrea Martin, Michael Emerson, Kurt Fuller, and Christine Lahti and some of the best cinematography on television, ***Evil*** was fun and challenging as it played with its protagonists every week. Audiences are still rightfully upset by the cancellation of this show and wondering where our trio would have gone in a fifth season. While the extended season four answered a few questions, the show wasn’t able to put a tidy bow on quite a few plotlines. We need more religious-based supernatural horror shows firing at this level that are unafraid to laugh at themselves. I worry that ***Evil*** might be the last show of its kind for a while.\\n\\n### 7. *Tomorrow and I* (Netflix)\\n\\nOn the surface, Paween Purijitpanya’s ***Tomorrow and I*** appeared to be Thailand’s answer to ***[Black Mirror](https://www.dreadcentral.com/editorials/430540/the-ultimate-ranking-of-black-mirror/)***. However, this four-episode sci-fi anthology quickly sets itself apart visually, emotionally, and spiritually from the other shows it draws default comparisons to. Every episode feels like a movie, and each tackles a different tough topic. I learned early on that the more fun I had with each story, the bigger the emotional toll I would have to pay before the credits rolled. While this show will take many viewers on a surprising emotional journey, the last frame of the final episode is what haunts me the most. What could have easily been a fun exercise in questioning technology’s role in society ***Tomorrow and I*** becomes a roller coaster. The highs are fun, and the lows are heavy, but the ride is ultimately one of the best things on TV in 2024.\\n\\n### 6. *Dead Boy Detectives* (Netflix)\\n\\n***Dead Boy Detectives*** was everything we have been begging for in a show. Well-written, fun, dark, queer, POC, and packed with badass women characters. So, of course, Netflix [canceled](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/501808/netflix-cancels-this-top-charting-horror-series-it-is-so-baffling/) it after one season. It’s especially upsetting because the lead actors George Rexstrew, Jayden Revri, and Kassius Nelson began this journey with so much effortless charm that it hurt. Can you imagine what they would’ve been capable of with more time to live in their characters and settle into this universe?\\n\\nNot only was this one of the best shows to come out in 2024, but watching these characters deal with relatable problems under hellish circumstances is something everyone still alive in this decade understands all too well. Whether you found a new chosen family while trying to get an abusive ex out of your head or told your best mate you have feelings for him while running from your demons, ***Dead Boy Detectives*** makes you feel seen.\\n\\n### 5. *Sweetpea* (STARZ)\\n\\nElla Purnell plays an overlooked girl who turns to murder in this dark, funny, and delightful series. British black comedies are usually a good time, but this one is so delicious that it feels criminal. We love a “good for her” moment, but ***Sweetpea*** takes it further as these kills become part of the character’s journey to live, laugh, and love. 2024 was another year filled with painful reminders that society hates women. So, watching a fed-up lady start giving people the business end of the knife was a welcome escape. Especially because most of the men she killed deserved it and then some. In my humble opinion, quite a few more people in her circle could also stand to be stabbed. If you also yearn for a bit of catharsis after the election or just enjoy watching women become killers, this show is a damn good time.\\n\\n### 4. *Interview with the Vampire*\\xa0(AMC+)\\n\\n***[Interview with the Vampire](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/502023/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review-amcs-underrated-gem-is-back-and-better-than-ever/)*** is a decadent treat. The horror series is filled with stunning performances and a design team that understands the assignment every single episode. I didn’t think the first season could not be rivaled, and I was sad to see my favorite Claudia (Bailey Bass) recast. However, Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid, Assad Zaman, and Delainey Hayles (stepping in as Claudia) embarked upon an even more vicious chapter of this saga. The second season brings more betrayal, more death, and more heartbreak. Even the finale gags the audience one more time for good measure. As someone who never liked the film adaptation, I never suspected there was so much drama to unpack with these messy vampires. This is one of those series that you long for between seasons. It is also one of the shows that makes social media exciting for the right reasons.\\n\\n### 3. *The Creep Tapes* (Shudder)\\n\\n***[Creep](https://www.dreadcentral.com/interviews/516514/the-creep-tapes-co-creators-mark-duplass-and-patrick-brice-on-playing-with-gender-watch/)*** continues to be one of the most weirdly addictive franchises of this millennium (so far). I never doubted that Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass would find a way to capture all of the WTF moments that made both films unsettling for TV. If anything, the six episodes on Shudder are not enough. Much like ***Chucky***, I now want this serial killer in a series format that allows us to spend more time with his evil deeds.\\n\\nDuplass has always been great, as this character especially, but ***[The Creep Tapes](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/516164/the-creep-tapes-review-mark-duplass-has-never-been-scarier/)*** is him at his most unhinged. Sure, the kills are great. Obviously, the Peachfuzz weirdness is cranked all the way up, and exploration of this character’s queerness feels like magnets pulling us in. However, it’s watching Duplass serve camp Christian counselor energy with a huge Norman Bates undertone that seals the deal. Who knew this was the way to make found footage horror work on TV?\\n\\n### 2. *True Detective: Night Country* (Max)\\n\\nLeave it to [Issa López](https://www.dreadcentral.com/interviews/472128/true-detective-night-country-director-issa-lopez-discusses-politics-in-horror/) to make the detective subgenre interesting and relevant again in 2024. She also pushed the series into its horror era when she took the reins as writer, director, and showrunner. While breaking up what seemed like a boys club, she also brought back appointment television. We had a weekly date with Jodie Foster, Kali Reis, and Fiona Shaw, and we were better people for it.\\n\\nBefore López’s arrival, ***[True Detective](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/471887/true-detective-night-country-review-chilling-frights-and-complicated-women/)***always seemed like one of those shows where actors I love find work that I would never watch (like most police procedurals). However, López dared to ask what happens when you fill this world with women. More importantly, what happens when the media stops pretending the cops are the heroes as it ignores the harm they cause to Brown people. I also lived for this series because I do not think I have ever seen so many Indigenous women on screen in my entire life.\\n\\n### 1. *From* (MGM+)\\n\\n***[From](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/510143/the-nightmarish-series-on-prime-video-stephen-king-calls-scary-as-hell-rises-charts-ahead-of-new-season/)***fuses horror and drama in a perfect balance that most shows struggle to find. This makes each character’s brutal death hurt because we cannot help but feel like we are part of the Fromily. This also makes for a compelling watch because no one is safe in the world of ***From***. No matter how closely you follow the rules or how hard you safeguard yourself, there is always something out of your control tapping at the window you forgot to double-check. Or something new scratching at the corners of your mind and getting under your skin.\\n\\nPart of the appeal of this show is that it feels like being a person born, raised, and surviving “unprecedented times”. It captures millennial anxiety, which is why it is the most terrifying thing on screen for three years in a row. This [Harold Perrineau](https://www.dreadcentral.com/cover-stories/517456/from-interview-harold-perrineau-on-making-tvs-scariest-cult-phenomenon-december-cover-story/)-led series has us under its spell, and we are so welcome.\\n\\n### Honorable Mentions\\n\\n2024 has been a lot, so I didn’t have the energy to argue with the internet. However, Lauren LeFranc’s ***The Penguin*** on Max was a gloriously cruel return to Gotham City and another show with a design team working overtime. It is also the first time Cristin Milioti has landed a role that deserves her. It’s a gripping crime thriller that flirts with a few genres and may fall through the cracks.\\n\\nLet me know if some of these picks made it into your top 10 list at [@misssharai](https://twitter.com/Misssharai).\\n\\nCategorized: [Editorials](https://www.dreadcentral.com/category/editorials/)\\n\\n## [October Cover Story](https://www.dreadcentral.com/cover-stories/545177/exclusive-elviras-great-big-october-cover-story-interview/)\\n\\n![October Cover Story — Elvira’s Great Big October Cover Story Interview](https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/elvira-good.jpg)\\n![Quantcast](//pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-wP9uAe3ADYc3w.gif)\",\n",

      "\n",
      "2024 has been such a bizarre year for genre television. We have Billy Crystal leading a psychological thriller called ***[Before](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/516905/before-exclusive-clip-lies-and-ice-skating/#:~:text=While%20Billy%20Crystal%20may%20be,light%20after%20his%20wife's%20death.)***on Apple TV+. The streamer also just recently started airing my beloved ***[Silo](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/456687/stephen-king-just-cannot-wait-for-next-episode-of-mysterious-and-excellent-streaming-series/)***[’](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/456687/stephen-king-just-cannot-wait-for-next-episode-of-mysterious-and-excellent-streaming-series/)s second season. ***[Uzumaki](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/403699/uzumaki-junji-itos-horror-manga-is-becoming-a-beautiful-series/)*** landed on Max and introduced some of us heathens to the warped world of Junji Ito. Netflix also did that thing they’ve become known for and dropped a bunch of South Korean thrillers that deserve way more attention. If you’re still subscribed, please check out ***The Frog***, ***The Trunk***, ***A Killer Paradox***, and ***The Bequeathed*** because you’ll love at least one of them. We also saw the abrupt (and wrongful) cancellation of ***[Chucky](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/500766/jennifer-tilly-talks-those-chucky-season-3-shocks-and-surprises-video-interview/)*** instead of what should have been a guaranteed fourth season. Speaking of goodbyes, ***[What We Do In The Shadows](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/513963/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-final-season-is-funny-but-is-it-going-anywhere/)*** is in the middle of taking a bow as I write this list.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a professional couch potato, this has been a lot of TV to keep up with. It’s also been some of the best distractions in these neverending “unprecedented times”. I have discovered a lot about myself while checking out what 2024 had to offer us serieswise. I learned I am more into the underseen ***Domino Day*** than the popular ***Agatha All Along.*** Stumbling upon ***My Undead Yokai Girlfriend***, ***Inspector Rishi,*** and ***Disclaimer*** served as reminders that sometimes sitting with a show before passing judgment is best. So, while I am about to rattle off the 10 best shows of the year, I encourage you to hit the apps. There’s so much buried treasure out there, and most of it deserves to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, here are the titles that I think are the best horror shows of 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 10. *Hysteria!* (Peacock)\n",
      "\n",
      "I was one of the many people who wrote this off as an attempt to cash in on the newest wave of Satan Panic horror caused by ***[Stranger Things’](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/430247/stranger-things-review-netflix-series-gets-to-its-nasty-horror-roots-with-dark-new-season/)*** latest season. However**, *[Hysteria!](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/514300/hysteria-review-bruce-campbells-new-show-makes-the-satanic-panic-fun/)*** turned out to be a very fun little binge in its own right. Benefiting from a fantastic performance by Julie Bowen and Bruce Campbell’s endless reservoir of coolness, this show took us on a chaotic ride. It also kept us guessing if anything satanic was really happening or if it was simply manifestations of our own fears until nearly the very end. So, while we’re having a good time watching teens get in trouble, we also have a very relevant conversation playing out. ***Hysteria!*** is the kind of predictable fun in period costumes that becomes a welcome palate cleanser between all of the darker fare we usually feast on.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 9. *Parasyte: The Grey* (Netflix)\n",
      "\n",
      "South Korea entered the chat with body-snatching gross goodness in 2024. This sci-fi horror mash-up has ***Invasion of the Body Snatchers*** and John Carpenter’s ***The Thing*** in its DNA. However, it quickly leans into wilder territory and something even more sinister as it becomes an addictive binge-watch. Based on the manga ***Parasyte*** by Hitoshi Iwaaki, ***[Parasyte: The Grey](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/500812/netflix-users-devour-top-charting-new-korean-horror-series-its-definitely-a-10-10/)*** is one of the itchiest, most paranoia-inducing shows of the year. In an era where alien invasions and live adaptations are struggling in the genre, it’s so cool to find a series that knocks it out of the park. This show is one of the reasons many of us are still talking to Netflix. Hopefully, the streamer greenlights a second season. We need more stories of lonely girls infected with mutant parasites learning it’s never too late to make friends. More tentacle-headed creatures battling would also be appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. *Evil* (Paramount+)\n",
      "\n",
      "When ***Evil*** was good, it was very very good. While the show spent its time fighting against its broadcast TV beginnings, it maintained its whimsically unique vibe and gorgeous aesthetic. Supported by a strong supporting cast including Andrea Martin, Michael Emerson, Kurt Fuller, and Christine Lahti and some of the best cinematography on television, ***Evil*** was fun and challenging as it played with its protagonists every week. Audiences are still rightfully upset by the cancellation of this show and wondering where our trio would have gone in a fifth season. While the extended season four answered a few questions, the show wasn’t able to put a tidy bow on quite a few plotlines. We need more religious-based supernatural horror shows firing at this level that are unafraid to laugh at themselves. I worry that ***Evil*** might be the last show of its kind for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. *Tomorrow and I* (Netflix)\n",
      "\n",
      "On the surface, Paween Purijitpanya’s ***Tomorrow and I*** appeared to be Thailand’s answer to ***[Black Mirror](https://www.dreadcentral.com/editorials/430540/the-ultimate-ranking-of-black-mirror/)***. However, this four-episode sci-fi anthology quickly sets itself apart visually, emotionally, and spiritually from the other shows it draws default comparisons to. Every episode feels like a movie, and each tackles a different tough topic. I learned early on that the more fun I had with each story, the bigger the emotional toll I would have to pay before the credits rolled. While this show will take many viewers on a surprising emotional journey, the last frame of the final episode is what haunts me the most. What could have easily been a fun exercise in questioning technology’s role in society ***Tomorrow and I*** becomes a roller coaster. The highs are fun, and the lows are heavy, but the ride is ultimately one of the best things on TV in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. *Dead Boy Detectives* (Netflix)\n",
      "\n",
      "***Dead Boy Detectives*** was everything we have been begging for in a show. Well-written, fun, dark, queer, POC, and packed with badass women characters. So, of course, Netflix [canceled](https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/501808/netflix-cancels-this-top-charting-horror-series-it-is-so-baffling/) it after one season. It’s especially upsetting because the lead actors George Rexstrew, Jayden Revri, and Kassius Nelson began this journey with so much effortless charm that it hurt. Can you imagine what they would’ve been capable of with more time to live in their characters and settle into this universe?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only was this one of the best shows to come out in 2024, but watching these characters deal with relatable problems under hellish circumstances is something everyone still alive in this decade understands all too well. Whether you found a new chosen family while trying to get an abusive ex out of your head or told your best mate you have feelings for him while running from your demons, ***Dead Boy Detectives*** makes you feel seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. *Sweetpea* (STARZ)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ella Purnell plays an overlooked girl who turns to murder in this dark, funny, and delightful series. British black comedies are usually a good time, but this one is so delicious that it feels criminal. We love a “good for her” moment, but ***Sweetpea*** takes it further as these kills become part of the character’s journey to live, laugh, and love. 2024 was another year filled with painful reminders that society hates women. So, watching a fed-up lady start giving people the business end of the knife was a welcome escape. Especially because most of the men she killed deserved it and then some. In my humble opinion, quite a few more people in her circle could also stand to be stabbed. If you also yearn for a bit of catharsis after the election or just enjoy watching women become killers, this show is a damn good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. *Interview with the Vampire* (AMC+)\n",
      "\n",
      "***[Interview with the Vampire](https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/502023/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-review-amcs-underrated-gem-is-back-and-better-than-ever/)*** is a decadent treat. The horror series is filled with stunning performances and a design team that understands the assignment every single episode. I didn’t think the first season could not be rivaled, and I was sad to see my favorite Claudia (Bailey Bass) recast. However, Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid, Assad Zaman, and Delainey Hayles (stepping in as Claudia) embarked upon an even more vicious chapter of this saga. The second season brings more betrayal, more death, and more heartbreak. Even the finale gags the audience one more time for good measure. As someone who never liked the film adaptation, I never suspected there was so much drama to unpack with these messy vampires. This is one of those series that you long for between seasons. It is also one of the shows that makes social media exciting for the right reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. *The Creep Tapes* (Shudder)\n",
      "\n",

       "   'content': 'While many TV series nowadays, horror or otherwise, limit themselves to single-digit episode counts and call it quits after a few seasons, *Supernatural* gleefully turned in 327 episodes over the span of 15 seasons. *American Horror Story* never seems to be afraid of going “too far.” While not every season of this anthology series has been a hit amongst fans, its shock factor is part of what makes the show so entertaining. One of the best things about this series is that, despite its decade-long run, a casual viewer can jump in at the beginning of almost any season and watch the horror stories that they are interested in without committing to the rest. By far one of the most successful-ever streaming series and an original that helped put Netflix on the map, this ’80s sci-fi/horror mashup dominates the cultural conversation and the internet’s servers any time a new season is released.',\n",

Still, for much of television’s early years, there wasn’t a ton of great horror series to speak of (aside from the truly iconic like *[The Twilight Zone](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-twilight-zone/)*). That has all changed now.\\n\\nWith the arrival of the 21st century has come a veritable explosion of great horror TV shows. Thanks to the influence of the 20th century creepy classic *[The X-Files](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-x-files/)*, TV storytellers now fully understand that horror belongs on TV just as much as it does in the movies. So we’ve gathered here the most terrifying TV shows the medium has to offer. Note that only shows that premiered in 2000 or later are eligible, which is why you won’t see the aforementioned *X-Files*.\\n\\n## 45. Teacup\\n\\n**Stream on:** Peacock (U.S.)\\n\\nWe know what you’re thinking. Why is this Peacock horror series about a gas-mask wearing predator prowling an isolated Georgia ranch called “Teacup?” Well, don’t worry about that right now. Because, regardless of what it’s called, *Teacup* brings the horror goods. Incorporating many genre elements, *Teacup* is loosely inspired by Robert R. McCammon’s 1988 novel *Stinger*, while updating it for the modern era.\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nOK, *now* you can know why it’s called *Teacup*. “Basically, it’s the barrier. ‘Tempest in a teacup’ is a turn of phrase. I’ve always wanted to make something called Teacup, but I didn’t know what,” [showrunner Ian McCulloch told *Den of Geek*](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/teacup-showrunner-ian-mcculloch-adapting-horror-epic/). *– Alec Bojalad*\\n\\n## 44. Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nHorror anthologies are the bread and butter of spooky storytelling on television. From *The Twilight Zone* all the way to *Black Mirror,* the format is so familiar that any show trying it out nowadays had better come through with a novel quirk. Thankfully Netflix found the right angle with this 2023 anthology series by simply letting horror legend and monster enthusiast Guillermo del Toro do whatever he wants.\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Ranking the Best Cabinet of Curiosities Episodes](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/ranking-the-best-cabinet-of-curiosities-episodes/)\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Cabinet of Curiosities: The Viewing is Pure Panos Cosmatos](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/cabinet-of-curiosities-the-viewing-is-pure-panos-cosmatos/)\\n\\nThe Academy Award-winning director curates the eight scary stories collected in *Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities*. He also serves as an enthusastic master of ceremonies, beginning each episode with a Serling-esque monologue before giving way for one of his hand-picked directors to cook. Like most anthologies, this *Cabinet of Curiosities* has its hits and its misses. But the hits are strong enough to make the whole thing worth watching. *– AB*\\n\\n## 43. Folklore\\n\\n**Stream on:** Max (U.S.)\\n\\nOne of the joys of the streaming era is Western audiences gaining increased access to international storytelling. *Folklore* is one such an example. *Folklore* isn’t just the name of a Taylor Swift album, it’s also a thrilling horror anthology on HBO Asia.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nThrough two seasons and 13 episodes, *Folklore* presents spooky stories based on Asian superstitions and myths. As curated by Singaporean director\\xa0Eric Khoo each episode is directed by a filmmaker from a different Asian country. *– AB*\\n\\n## 42. Dead Set\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.K.)\\n\\n[*Black Mirror*](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror-ranking-every-episode/) before *Black Mirror* existed, this five-part satirical horror series was Charlie Brooker’s first solo screenwriting credit. It combined the former TV critic’s fascination with reality show *Big Brother* with imagined scenarios so apocalyptically bleak that they become funny. The premise was simple: a zombie virus breaks out in the UK during a series of *Big Brother*, leaving the contestants in the dark about what’s happening until it’s too late.\\n\\nWhat made *Dead Set* special was the level of detail in both the reality spoof and the horror strand. The involvement of real show presenter Davina McCall, Channel 4 newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and a huge number of former contestants willing to zombie-up and eat some internal organs made it totally convincing. The zombies were also hardcore and responsible for some surprisingly tense and extremely gross moments. Airing over consecutive nights in the run-up to Halloween 2008, it delivered proper zombie gore, cultural comment, and the memorable sight of Andy Nyman as a TV producer screaming obscenities at the dupes he’d exploited while they chewed on his guts and ripped out his spine. Unforgettable. – *Louisa Mellor*\\n\\n## 41. Yellowjackets\\n\\n**Stream on:** Paramount+ (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*[Yellowjackets](https://www.denofgeek.com/yellowjackets/)* has teen drama, creepy cults, hints of cannibalism, and a compelling mystery, both in the past and the present, that will keep you hooked on the spooky series. In 1996, a plane crash leaves the Yellowjackets soccer team stranded in the Canadian wilderness. Twenty-five years later, the survivors still struggle with the trauma of what they went through, and the lengths they went to survive. Taking us between 1996 and the present day, *Yellowjackets* expertly balances psychological horror with the supernatural – it’s not clear yet if there really is a sinister force with them in the wilderness or if the weird happenings are just a combination of coincidence and trauma.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Yellowjackets Continues the Feminist Legacy of The Golden Girls](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/yellowjackets-feminist-legacy-of-the-golden-girls/)\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Juliette Lewis Gives Yellowjackets the Tragic Jesse Pinkman Figure It Needs](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/juliette-lewis-yellowjackets-tragic-jesse-pinkman-figure/)\\n\\nThe casting of the young girls and their adult counterparts is phenomenal, with their performances and personalities blending almost seamlessly between the timelines. Even though this method of storytelling means that we know early on whether some of the girls survive, it honestly doesn’t take away from the stakes of their time in the wild. Every flashback is still full of tension and suspense as we learn more about what the Yellowjackets were up against. *– Brynna Arens*\\n\\n## 40. Brand New Cherry Flavor\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*[Brand New Cherry Flavor](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/brand-new-cherry-flavor-netflix-horror-with-kittens/)* is, as the kids say, a whole-ass vibe. Created by TV horror auteur Nick Antosca (who will pop up again on this list later) and based on a novel of the same name, this Netflix series follows amateur filmmaker Lisa Nova (Rosa Salazar) who has her first feature stolen by an unscrupulous director.\\n\\nLisa’s path for revenge will take her through a grimy, gothic version of Hollywood complete with voodoo witches, zombies, and even some nice kittens. As its basically meaningless but still provocative name suggests, *Brand New Cherry Flavor* is all about capturing a strange giallo sensibility on the small screen. And it mostly succeeds in doing so. *– AB*\\n\\n## 39. Ju-On: Origins\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*Ju-On*, or *The Grudge*, is one of the most iconic horror film franchises of the 21st century. So it was only a matter of time before the beloved Japanese ghost story got its own TV series, which it finally did in 2020 with Netflix prequel series *[Ju-On: Origins](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/ju-on-origins-review/)*.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nNotable as being the first and only Ju-On project without the terrifying Kayako Saeki ([you know her when you see her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayako_Saeki)), *Ju-On: Origins* follows the…well, origins of the never-ending vengeful ghostly nightmare. The six-episode show updates the *Ju-On* canon and injects it with some fresh energy to keep the grudge alive. *– AB*\\n\\n## 38. The Secret of Crickley Hall\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), Hulu (U.S.)\\n\\nThis neat [three-part adaptation](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-secret-of-crickley-hall-episode-1-review/) just about has it all: a top cast, genuine chills, and an involving mystery story. If you’re after a haunted house thriller with a bit of emotional heft to it, you can’t go too wrong here. Written and directed by *Ultraviolet* and *Doctor Who*’s Joe Ahearne, *The Secret of Crickley Hall* is told in two different time periods – the modern day (well, 2012, when it aired on BBC One) and the 1940s – in the same location: the ominous-sounding village of Devil’s Cleave.\\n\\nDevil’s Cleave is where the Caleigh family move a year after suffering a terrible loss, and it’s where Suranne Jones’ Eve Caleigh confronts her grief while immersed in spooky goings-on that go back much further than a year. Tom Ellis plays Eve’s husband Gabe, with *Game of Thrones*’ Maisie Williams as their daughter Loren, while the rest of the cast include *House of the Dragon*’s Olivia Cooke, *The Winter King*’s [Iain de Caestecker](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/iain-de-caestecker-on-bbc-thriller-the-control-room/) and screen veteran David Warner. Adapted from James Herbert’s 2006 novel of the same name, this is a condensed hit of mystery and good old-fashioned ghostly thrills. – *LM*\\n\\n## 37. Castle Rock\\n\\n**Stream on:** Hulu (U.S.)\\n\\nThe Stephen King renaissance was in full swing on the big screen by 2018 after the success of *It Chapter One*. Surely, it was time for Uncle Stevie to rise again on TV as well? While several other King adaptations hit streaming around that time, few were as ambitious as Hulu’s *Castle Rock*, which sought to tie in several of the author’s most famous stories into one cohesive and interconnected narrative. Spoiler: the show didn’t always live up to that scope, but when it clicked, it really clicked.\\n\\n## Latest TV reviews\\n\\n## [Haunted Hotel Review: Netflix Series Continues Paranormal Hospitality Comedy Trend](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/haunted-hotel-review-netflix/)\\n\\n## [Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3 Episode 10 Review — New Life and New Civilizations](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-3-episode-10-review-new-life-and-new-civilizations/)\\n\\n## [Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3 Episode 9 Review — Terrarium](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-3-episode-9-review-terrarium/)\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Stephen King’s Storm of the Century Is the Author’s Forgotten TV Masterpiece](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/stephen-king-storm-of-the-century-forgotten-tv-masterpiece/)\\n\\n[Movies](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/)\\n\\n### [Salem’s Lot Adaptations Keep Getting Stephen King’s Vampire Wrong](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/salems-lot-adaptations-keep-getting-stephen-king-vampire-wrong/)\\n\\nIn its two seasons on the air, *Castle Rock* brought us memorable new takes on classic King characters such as Alan Pangborn, “Pop” Merrill, and especially Annie Wilkes (played by Lizzy Caplan in a career-best performance), while also roping in actors from throughout King cinematic history, including Tim Robbins and Sissy Spacek. Even Bill Skarsgård, fresh off playing Pennywise the Clown, popped up in the series in a major role. There’s simply never been a celebration of the writer’s legacy quite like this show, even if it sort of fell apart in its second season. The mysteries introduced in this version of King’s most famous setting, plus all the Easter eggs and nods to Constant Readers, make this trip to haunted Maine worth it. And there are a few good scares to get the heart pumping to boot! – *John Saavedra*\\n\\n## 36. Being Human\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), AMC+ (U.S.) BritBox (U.S.), Sky (U.K.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.)\\n\\nNot the scariest show on this list by a long chalk, but one of the best-loved and for very good reason. Toby Whithouse’s supernatural flat-share series was one of the greatest things to come out of BBC Three. Funny, geeky, with a cast of future stars including [*Poldark*](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/poldark-a-beginners-guide/)’s Aidan Turner, *Avenue 5*’s Lenora Crichlow and *Years and Years*’ Russell Tovey, this comedy-drama spawned a US remake and a lot of well-deserved love. The story of a vampire, a ghost and a werewolf trying to, well, *be* human, is a great time.\\n\\nIt was also capable of being pretty scary. The black-eyeball vampire effect never failed to cause a shudder, even when (or perhaps *because*) it was preceded by a gag about *The Antiques Roadshow* or Jammie Dodgers. Jason Watkins’ Herrick was a horrible piece of work, as was Mark Gatiss’ creepy Mr Snow later on. The werewolf transformations and bloody massacres put it firmly on the horror category, while storylines like Owen’s in series one proved the age-old rule that people can be the scariest monsters of all. – *LM*\\n\\n## 35. From\\n\\n**Stream on:** MGM+ (U.S.), Sky (U.K.), Now (U.K.)\\n\\nYou’ve heard of a haunted house but what about a haunted town? That’s the situation facing the characters of MGM+’s (formerly EPIX) horror series *[From](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/harold-perrineau-epix-from-learned-from-lost/)*. Like *Under the Dome* before it, *From* takes place in a small American town from which there’s no escape. Unlike *Under the Dome*, however, *From*‘s fishbowl Township just happens to be inhabited by terrifying nocturnal creatures.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\n*From* features a command performance from sci-fi veteran Harold Perrineau (*Lost*) as de facto town mayor Boyd Stevens and is able to keep up the menacing tension of something very wrong in small town Middle America. *– AB*\\n\\n## 34. Hellbound\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nSouth Korean series *[Hellbound](https://www.denofgeek.com/hellbound/)* boasts a very compelling concept that it executes quite well. The show, created by Yeon Sang-ho (and based on his webtoon of the same name), imagines a world in which angels periodically appear to human beings to condemn them to hell … at extremely specific varying times.\\n\\nThe dark joy of *Hellbound* is that when the demons arrive to drag someone to hell, they don’t do so gently. These buff, demonic bruisers absolutely beat the ever-loving shit out of people to create a public spectacle. Seriously, it’s so wild. After a well-received six episode first season, [*Hellbound* just received a follow-up](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/hellbound-season-2-deadly-mix-influencer-culture-extremism/). Get in on the action now before the angels confirm your fate. *– AB*\\n\\n## 33. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n[*Chilling Adventures of Sabrina*](https://www.denofgeek.com/chilling-adventures-of-sabrina/) stirred stereotypical satanic mythology and pagan blasphemy into an alchemical brew to concoct a dark anti-Archie universe. Netflix invoked Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Robert Hack’s “Afterlife with Archie” series from “Archie Horror” for a supernatural alternative to the town of Riverdale. In the tradition of *Bewitched*, witches are a separate breed than their mortal counterparts, and the town of Glendale didn’t get the publicity of Salem, but in 1692, 13 witches were hanged in the forest and their descendants persist.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nKiernan Shipka plays Sabrina Spellman, a moody teen who is half-human and half-witch. She gets things right half the time, but at twice the cost. She celebrated her not-so-sweet sixteen with a Dark Baptism, signing her name into the “Book of the Beast,” and went on to challenge patriarchy at both Baxter High and the School of Unseen Arts, as well as covens, teams, clubs, and talent show nights. She even double-teamed Satan in a match she won all by herself. *– Tony Sokol*\\n\\n## 32. The Fall of the House of Usher\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*The Fall of the House of Usher* is horror maestro Mike Flangan’s most recent (and likely final) spooky TV project for Netflix. It’s also undoubtedly his most ambitious. This eight episode series adapts not only Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher” but [basically every other Poe work, major and minor, as well](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-edgar-allan-poe-references-explained/).\\n\\nTold through a modern days lens with the story of a Sackler-esque corrupt family of opioid manufacturers, *The Fall of the House of Usher* is a bruising, cynical work about greed. It’s also quite scary at times! The horror levels of each episode can vary (as each is based on a different Poe work) but it’s hard to get the terrifying images from “The Masque of the Red Death” or “The Tell-Tale Heart” out of our heads. *– AB*\\n\\n## 31. 30 Coins\\n\\n**Stream on:** Max (U.S.)\\n\\n*30 Coins* (or *30 Monedas* in its native Spanish) is a Spanish horror series from Álex de la Iglesia for HBO Europe. The show follows the Catholic exorcist Padre Manuel Vergara (Eduard Fernández) as he attempts to move on from his troubled past in the small town of Pedraza. While that sounds like the setup for a demonic possession story, *30 Coins* goes off in a much more interesting direction.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nThe series doesn’t shy away from paranormal phenomena, but it all has to do with a mysterious coin that may be one of the “thirty pieces of silver” paid to Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus Christ. That’s right, friends: we’ve got a Catholic mystery horror story on our hands!*30 Coins* made enough waves in its well-received first season for none other than Paul Giamatti to join the series in season 2. *– AB*\\n\\n## 30. Servant\\n\\n**Streaming on:** Apple TV+ (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nHorror movie aficionados have enjoyed [M. Night Shyamalan](https://www.denofgeek.com/m-night-shyamalan/)‘s career renaissance of late as the legendary *Sixth Sense* filmmaker has started to churn out more offbeat B-movies like *Split*, *Old*, and *Trap*. Long before Shyamalan began indulging his crowd-pleasing tendencies at the box office, horror TV fans knew he was ready to really let his freak flag fly thanks to his work on Apple TV+’s *Servant*.\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Servant Ending Explained: Is There a Shyamalan Twist?](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/servant-ending-explained-is-there-a-shyamalan-twist/)\\n\\n[Movies](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/)\\n\\n### [M. Night Shyamalan Movies Ranked](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/m-night-shyamalan-movies-ranked/)\\n\\nFirst premiering in late 2019 as one of the Apple streaming service’s launch titles, *Servant* is a wonderfully odd little show. Its original premise is a spooky one – a Philadelphia couple (always Philly with this guy) purchases an uncanny “reborn doll” called Jericho to deal with the loss of their infant child. The commit to the bit extends to them bringing a young nanny into their home, who mysteriously interacts with Jericho as though he were real. To say that *Servant* uses this plot as a mere launching off point would be putting it lightly. The show’s four season run is filled with increasingly discomfiting horror that will keep the viewer off-balance throughout. *– AB*\\n\\n## 29. The Enfield Haunting\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), Tubi (U.S.), Sky (U.K.) Now (U.K.)\\n\\nSky Living was a short-lived British TV channel that specialised in celeb-fronted reality shows, glossy US imports and ropey paranormal investigations. That last interest explains the commissioning of three-part 2015 drama *The Enfield Haunting*, which turned out to be an outlier among its channel-mates as a quality drama with an acclaimed cast including Timothy Spall and Matthew Macfadyen, and a buzzy director in *The Killing*’s Krystoffer Nyholm.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nThe story will be familiar to paranormal fans as one of the most widely reported “real-life” poltergeist hauntings around. It’s since been told in [*The Conjuring 2*](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-conjuring-2-enfield-case-true-story-janet-bill-wilkins-tape/) and in Apple TV+ series *The Enfield Poltergeist*, as well as in countless podcasts, articles and books. In the 1970s, the Hodgson family in Enfield became briefly notorious in the tabloid press for claiming to be haunted by a malevolent spirit who targeted young Janet Hodgson. Their claims were investigated by psychic investigators Playfair and Grosse (Macfadyen and Spall), whose scepticism was dashed by the encounter. What makes *The Enfield Haunting* special is that it works equally well for believers and non-believers, as either a spooky document or a portrait of a damaged family and a traumatised man. *– LM*\\n\\n## 28. Bates Motel\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.)\\n\\nSpinning off one of the most iconic horror films for television is harrowing, difficult stuff. But A&E’s *Psycho* prequel *Bates Motel* is far more successful in the attempt than it has any right to be. This two-hander stars Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore giving some larger-than-life performances as the iconic and damaged Motherboy duo of Norma and Norman Bates.\\n\\nThrough five seasons (and one pretty great Rihanna guest star appearance in the final season) *Bates Motel* was able to maintain an admirable fraction of Psycho’s tension. Inspired by *Twin Peaks* as much as its progenitor film, *Bates Motel* brought some tasty horror mystery to the table. *– AB*\\n\\n## 27. In the Flesh\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), Hulu (U.S.), Peacock (U.S.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.), Sky (U.K.)\\n\\n*[In the Flesh](https://www.denofgeek.com/in-the-flesh/)* delivered a distinctly British twist on the zombie-horror genre by grounding its story of an undead uprising in Alan Bennett-style humour, and political satire. It’s the story of Kieren Walker, a sensitive outsider in the rural Northern village of Roarton, where one night years ago, corpses rose from their graves and went on a murderous rampage. Now the surviving zombies (or sufferers of “Partially Deceased Syndrome” to use the official parlance) have been medicated and reintroduced to the community. Will Roarton accept them, or will hatred of the anti-“rotter” brigade win out?\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nCruelly cut short by the BBC Three funding issues that led to the channel’s (since reversed) move to online-only, *In The Flesh* is a beloved cult favourite. The least macho, most moving zombie story around, Dominic Mitchell’s two series are funny, pithy and packed with protest at bigotry and intolerance. *– LM*\\n\\n## 26. Parasyte: The Grey\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nReleased in 2024, gooey body snatcher series *Parasyte: The Grey* is the latest bit of evidence that South Korea represents the future of episodic horror. This Netflix offering deals with a group of mysterious parasitic creatures that have arrived to Earth from outer space and subsequently use its human populations as hosts, contorting their fleshy bodies into horrifying, unnatural shapes.\\n\\nCharmingly, *Parasyte: The Grey* is just as concerned with the solution as it is the problem as much of the show follows the titular police force “The Grey” as it combats the alien threat while keeping it all on the down low. At only six episodes, *Parasyte: The Grey* is a breezy, spooky watch that continues director Yeon Sang-ho’s (*Train to Busan*) horror winning streak very much alive. *– AB*\\n\\n## 25. The Exorcist\\n\\n**Stream on:** Hulu (U.S.), Prime Video (U.K.)\\n\\n*[The Exorcist](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-exorcist/)* was repossessed prematurely. Evicted without notice from the soul of Fox, the series was poised to move past its Holy Roman Catholic traditions into global perdition. When the series began, Geena Davis played Angela Rance, a woman trying to save her possessed daughter.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\nThe first season dipped wax onto William Peter Blatty’s 1971 novel, before breaking new ground in the satanic possession genre. Biblical visions doubled as neuroses, and psychoses are masked as supernaturally malevolent. The devil isn’t the biggest evil in the series, and it takes more than reciting the 91st Psalm and humming a few bars “Ave Maria” to root it out. There is duplicity in the church. The series immersed itself in the world of the rogue priests who lost the voice but still heard the calling. *– TS*\\n\\n## 24. The Terror\\n\\n**Stream on:** AMC+ (U.S.), Shudder (U.K.)\\n\\nWhen you’re bold enough to name a show *The Terror* you’d better come through with the promised terror. Thankfully AMC’s horror series isn’t lacking in that department. Based on Dan Simmons’ 2007 novel, *The Terror* is so-named because of the fictional ship the *HMS Terror* at its center. When *The Terror* finds itself lost in the icy Northwest Passage, its crew must struggle to survive the elements and the potentially supernatural threat lurking around.\\n\\n*The Terror* season 1 is quite simply a spooky good time featuring a high-powered cast including the likes of Jared Harris, Tobias Menzies, and Ciarán Hinds. AMC tried to adapt the show to the anthology format with *The Terror* season 2 telling an entirely new story altogether. That season, *The Terror: Infamy*, took place in Japanese internment camps in World War II. It wasn’t as well received as season 1 but it’s still there for the horror completists. *– AB*\\n\\n## 23. Sweet Home\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nDo you love monsters? Then boy does Netflix have a horror TV series for you! Premiering in 2020, apocalyptic scream-fest *Sweet Home* was the first South Korean series to enter Netflix’s Top Ten, nearly a full year before *Squid Game* would change the game forever for Korean entertainment in the Western streaming world.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\n*Sweet Home*‘s success is well-earned as this is a lovingly crafted series about the struggle to survive apocalyptic circumstances against some very frightening monsters. From gluttons to lotus roots to good old-fashioned vampires, *Sweet Home*‘s monster types are both diverse and beautifully rendered. Add in a sympathetic hero with a troubled past and you’ve got 10 enjoyably intense episodes. *– AB*\\n\\n## 22. Ash vs Evil Dead\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), Netflix (U.K.)\\n\\nWhen Sam Raimi’s landmark horror film *[The Evil Dead](https://www.denofgeek.com/evil-dead/)* first arrived in 1981, who could have imagined that it would spawn a decades-spanning franchise? Honestly, pretty much everyone could have imagined that. Or at least they should have been able to. *Evil Dead* rules! After a sequel in 1987, another in 1992, and a remake in 2013, *[Ash v. Evil Dead](https://www.denofgeek.com/ash-vs-evil-dead/)* become the latest (and to this date final) iteration of this most excellent horror concept.\\n\\nBruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash Williams for this 2016 Starz series. It’s been 30 years since the events of *Army of Darkness* and Ash is a bit worse for wear. Instead of slaying zombies, the action hero now works as a stock boy at a local grocery store and ends most days at the bottom of a bottle. But that all changes when the other side of “Ash vs” returns and the Evil Dead walk the earth once again. *– AB*\\n\\n## 21. Lovecraft Country\\n\\n**Stream on:** Max (U.S.), Tubi (U.S.), Sky (U.K.) Now (U.K.)\\n\\nPart horror anthology, part exploration of Jim Crow era America, and part magical bildungsroman for its leader character – *[Lovecraft Country](https://www.denofgeek.com/lovecraft-country/)* was a tough nut to crack for many viewers. Perhaps that’s why it lasted for only one season on HBO. Still, this Misha Green-developed series (with producing help from J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele) still burned rather brightly in its short time on Earth.\\n\\nAd\\n\\nAd – content continues below\\n\\n*Lovecraft Country* follows the 1950s Freeman family, made up of an impressive cast that includes Jurnee Smollett, Jonathan Majors, Aunjanue Ellis, Wunmi Mosaku, Jamie Chung, and Michael K. Williams. While a larger narrative about the Freemans destiny eventually develops, the show is really more of a monster-of-the-week experience that combines classic horror tropes (and [some truly terrifying creatures](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/meet-the-monsters-of-lovecraft-country/)) with political commentary about sundown towns and housing discrimination. The loose narrative format may have been a touch confusing but when Lovecraft Country brought the horror hammer down it was one of TV’s most terrifying experiences. *– AB*\\n\\n## 20. The Fades\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), Hulu (U.S.), Peacock (U.S.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.), ITVX (U.K.)\\n\\nAnother British horror series cut unforgivably short by BBC budget restraints (see also: *In the Flesh*), *The Fades* had scale, scares, and scope, not to mention a cast so well-chosen they became some of the biggest names in screen fantasy (*Lucifer*’s Tom Ellis, *Game of Thrones*’ Natalie Dormer and Joe Dempsie, *Agents of SHIELD*’s Iain de Caestecker and Oscar-winning *Get Out* star Daniel Kaluuya).\\n\\nIt’s the story of Paul, a teenager with the power to see spirits of the dead trapped on Earth. Paul learns that his apocalyptic visions aren’t simply the work of his imagination; he’s an “Angelic” – one of a group locked in celestial battle with the malevolent titular “Fades.” Created by Jack Thorne (*Skins*, *This is England*, *His Dark Materials*), this six-episode series boasts proper horror, compelling and convincing characters, plus a script packed with geeky pop culture references. It should have had six seasons and a movie. *– LM*\\n\\n## 19. Interview with the Vampire\\n\\n**Stream on:** AMC+ (U.S.), Sky (U.K.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.)\\n\\n*[Interview with the Vampire](https://www.denofgeek.com/interview-with-the-vampire/)* is one of the best TV series on this list full stop. The AMC adaptation of Anne Rice’s beloved *Vampire Chronicles* novels is a lush, sensuous journey into the un-lives of the dead and the beautiful. Co-stars Jacob Anderson and Sam Reid bring a rippling chemistry to the central pairing of vampires Louis de Pointe du Lac and Lestat de Lioncourt as the former recounts the bloody details of their tortured romance to journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian).\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Interview with the Vampire: The Biggest Changes From Anne Rice’s Book](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/interview-with-the-vampire-biggest-changes-from-anne-rice-book/)\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Interview with the Vampire Season 2 Ending Explained: How Can a Vampire Be Killed?](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-ending-explained/)\\n\\n*Interview with the Vampire* is about as much fun as any TV show can be. But is it proper horror? Sure, why not! While the story and its visuals undoubtedly lean more to the side of “Gothic romance,” this Rolin Jones-created effort is bursting with horror imagery and tropes. It’s just hard to call it scary as its leads are so charming that you’ll delight in every vampire feeding session, rather than recoil. *– AB*\\n\\n## 18. Supernatural\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S.), Prime Video (U.K.)\\n\\nThe CW’s *[Supernatural](https://www.denofgeek.com/supernatural/)* represents nothing less than the awesome storytelling potential of a long-running TV show. While many TV series nowadays, horror or otherwise, limit themselves to single-digit episode counts and call it quits after a few seasons, *Supernatural* gleefully turned in 327 episodes over the span of 15 seasons. What did viewers get for investing that kind of time into one narrative? A whole hell of a lot.\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [The Folklore Behind Supernatural’s First Ever Monster](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/folklore-behind-supernatural-first-ever-monster/)\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [10 Ways Supernatural Can Reboot Without Disrupting Its Current Canon](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/10-ways-supernatural-can-reboot-without-disrupting-canon/)\\n\\nThe Eric Kripke-created series starts out modestly enough with Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) hunting demons, ghouls, and other various monsters from week-to-week. But not even halfway through its run, *Supernatural* realized it needed to go a bit bigger so it opted to just throw in the forces of heaven and hell as well. Despite its modest network budget, *Supernatural* is both a satisfying, and at times scary, experience. Sometimes all you need is a ’67 Impala and a dream. *– AB*\\n\\n## 17. The Haunting of Bly Manor\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nThere are few shows out there that are able to combine horror and romance without losing something from each genre, and Mike Flanagan’s sophomore Netflix series *[The Haunting of Bly Manor](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-haunting-of-bly-manor/)* is one of them. *The Haunting of Bly Manor* doesn’t wimp out on scares nor does the relationship between Dani (Victoria Pedretti) and Jamie (Amelia Eve) feel cheesy or forced – instead the ghost stories and love story are intertwined into a single compelling narrative.\\n\\nSet at the titular Bly Manor in the 1980s, the series begins with the hiring of Dani as the governess for the Wingrave children. Because young British children in a giant house are rarely not creepy, things get weird pretty fast as the children seem to be aware of the spirits that also call Bly Manor home. This series feels haunting, not just because of the ghosts, but rather in how much the characters – both living and dead – and their stories stick with you. While *The Haunting of Bly Manor* is not necessarily the most nightmare-inducing story ever told, it features a unique level of emotional devastation that can make even the most hardened horror-buff shed a tear. *– BA*\\n\\n## 16. All of Us Are Dead\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nReleased just months after the global phenomenon that was *Squid Game*, this Korean coming-of-age horror series about a group of doomed teens trying to survive a zombie apocalypse inside their overrun high school is the perfect companion piece. Equal parts horrifying, hilarious, and gruesome as hell, *[All of Us Are Dead](https://www.denofgeek.com/all-of-us-are-dead/)* is easily the best piece of zombie entertainment of this decade so far not called *The Last of Us*.\\n\\nThe show’s greatest strength is its ability to create something fresh out of the genre’s well-worn tropes. Despite way too many seasons of *The Walking Dead*, this K-drama finds something new to say not just about zombies but also the high-stress high school life that haunts the show’s kids even more than the flesh-hungry monsters waiting to eat them in the hallways. With a memorable central cast, intense set pieces that often devolve into delicious chaos, lots of scares, and so many twists and turns, *All of Us Are Dead* is definitely one to binge on a weekend. *– JS*\\n\\n## 15. The Walking Dead\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S.), Prime Video (U.K.), Disney+ (U.K.)\\n\\nAfter 11 seasons ([and some spinoffs](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-walking-dead-every-spinoff-in-development/)), it’s inarguable that *[The Walking Dead](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-walking-dead/)* franchise has gotten a bit long in the tooth. Maintaining true horror over more than 170 episodes should be impossible to achieve. And yet, AMC’s flagship zombie series is frequently very scary.\\n\\nNaturally, it all starts with the zombies. The shambling undead flesh-devourers are brought to life in spectacularly vivid detail by a makeup effects team led by producer/director Greg Nicotero. Every episode of this show is guaranteed to have at least one stomach-churning depiction of a zombie. Beyond the walkers, however, *The Walking Dead* takes it responsibility to scare and unsettle viewers seriously. Even in the ill-received latter seasons, this show makes time for standout horror episodes like [“On the Inside.”](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-walking-dead-season-11-episode-6-review-on-the-inside/) *– AB*\\n\\n## 14. What We Do in the Shadows\\n\\n**Stream on:** Hulu (U.S.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.)\\n\\nStaten Island’s most infamous vampires survived swinging guillotines at Nouveau Thétre des Vampires, true death [judgements of the Vampiric Council](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-vampiric-council/), dodgeball matches with werewolves, confusions of daylight savings, and the perils of introducing a child character into a successful sitcom. All without running out of blood to spill or legends to deflate. Based on the movie by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, FX’s [*What We Do in the Shadows*](https://www.denofgeek.com/us/what-we-do-in-the-shadows)’ is this decade’s *Addams Family*, with a rogue’s gallery of classic comedy influences.\\n\\nNandor the Relentless (Kayvan Novak), Nadja of Antipaxos (Natasia Demetriou), Laszlo Cravensworth (Matt Berry), energy vampire Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), and their familiar-turned-bodyguard-turned-babysitting best man Guillermo (Harvey Guillén) are as beloved as *The Munsters*, frightful as the Fangtasia regulars on *True Blood*, and clueless as the spies on *Get Smart*. Nothing is sacred and no cliché is spared. Even the great vampires of cinema masquerading as actors, like Tilda Swinton, Paul Rubens, and the Half-Vampire Wesley Snipes, give blood on a regular basis. *– TS*\\n\\n## 13. Marianne\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nNo matter that this 2019 French horror wasn’t renewed – one creepy series of this calibre is quite enough, merci (Google “Madame Daugeron grinning” for a taste). This eight-part story trod familiar horror ground, but did it with such aplomb that its classic scares felt almost new. The show that made screenwriter Quoc Dang Tran’s name in France, [*Marianne*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99hib0zS2M) is the story of Emma Larsimon, a successful French horror writer who exorcised her childhood nightmares by putting them on the page. Or at least she *thought* she’d exorcised them.\\n\\nWhen the ghoul her protagonist Lizzie faces in the novels starts to bleed out of her books and visit her once again, she’s forced back to her hometown to confront her past. It’s a decent homecoming drama, but a much more effective horror that plays with the line between the real and imaginary to great effect. Victoire Du Bois (*Call Me By Your Name*) is great as Emma, but it’s Mireille Herbstmeyer’s face you won’t be able to shake. *– LM*\\n\\n## 12. Evil\\n\\n**Stream on:** Paramount+ (U.S.), Sky (U.K.)\\n\\nEver since *The X-Files* signed off in 2002 (and then again in 2016 and 2018), the network TV procedural horror crown has just been sitting there, ready for the taking. In 2019 Robert and Michelle King, *The Good Wife*/*The Good Fight* creators who know a thing or two about network TV procedurals, decided to go ahead and grab it. Granted, *[Evil](https://www.denofgeek.com/evil/)* lasted for one season on CBS before being bumped to the more creatively-freeing streaming waters of Paramount+. But regardless of where *Evil* premieres its episodes, it’s one of the best horror shows the medium has to offer.\\n\\n*Evil* follows a trio of paranormal investigators who look into miracles on behalf of the Catholic Church: Priest-in-training David Acosta (Mike Colter) is the believer, tech expert Ben Shakir (Aasif Mandvi) is the skeptic, and forensic psychologist Dr. Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers) lies somewhere in the middle. Each week, *Evil* presents a new case-of-the-week that could be legitimately supernatural or could have a perfectly reasonable explanation. It’s up to the team (and viewers) to figure it out. *Evil* is truly terrifying at times and masterfully balances its weekly storytelling format with a larger arc that examines whether evil is demonic in nature or lies in the dark heart of mankind. *– AB*\\n\\n## 11. Inside No. 9\\n\\n**Stream on:** BritBox (U.S.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.), Sky (U.K.)\\n\\nIt might usually be filed under “comedy,” but no TV show is as well steeped in the horror genre as *Inside No. 9*. Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s anthology series has delivered scares and creepiness of every variety. There was the Hammer camp of “[The Harrowing](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/behind-the-scenes-on-inside-no-9s-most-terrifying-episode/)” starring Helen McCrory as a glamorous vampire, the paranormal freakiness of “Séance Time” with its child haunting, the horrific twist of Krampus-themed 1970s homage “The Devil of Christmas”, master horror hoax “Deadline” which posed as a live episode before things started to go very, very wrong… and most recently, “[The Bones of St Nicholas](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/inside-no-9-the-bones-of-st-nicholas-review/)”, a Christmas-set ghost story that would make M.R. James cry for his mummy.\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Every Single Inside No. 9 Episode Was an Easter Egg in the Series Finale](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/every-single-inside-no-9-episode-was-an-easter-egg-in-the-series-finale/)\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Inside No. 9’s Best Guest Performances](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/inside-no-9-best-guest-performances/)\\n\\nAdd to that countless grisly murders and executions, necromancy, more vampires, a bonafide witch, skeletal babies and more fiendish twists than is medically advisable, and it’s clear that *Inside No. 9* is the real horror deal. The real wonder is that it manages to find laughs among all the nightmares. *-LM*\\n\\n## 10. The Last of Us\\n\\n**Stream on:** Max (U.S.), Sky (U.K.), Now (U.K.)\\n\\nThe first goal of *[The Last of Us](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-last-of-us/)*, the brilliant HBO adaptation of Naughty Dog’s equally brilliant game, isn’t necessarily to terrify you. Despite beginning with the end of the world due to a (real) fungus that [turns human beings into flower monsters](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-last-of-us-are-the-infected-zombies/), *The Last of Us* is more focused with human concerns like love, survival, and how they often tragically intersect. But here’s the thing though…it’s still really freaking scary.\\n\\nThe nine-episode first season frequently captures the acute moments of terror that the game is known for. “Wait where’s the mushroom freak? I think I saw something move. Ellie, pay attention. Ellie, Joel … WATCH OUT!” And that’s not even to mention the pitch perfect zombie apocalypse drama that is the show’s first episode. *The Last of Us* works because the show gets its depiction of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) right. It soars because it gets the horror of a human mushroom just as right as well. *– AB*\\n\\n## 9. Channel Zero\\n\\n**Stream on:** AMC+ (U.S.)\\n\\nSince the launch of *The Twilight Zone*, horror anthologies have been a dime a dozen on TV. Few of them, however, are nearly as terrifying as this little-seen but much beloved creepypasta series on Syfy. Yes, *Channel Zero* gets all of its story ideas from the most terrifying place known to man: the internet. Showrunner Nick Antosca and the rest of the production team find the spookiest creepypastas the World Wide Web has to offer and then adapts them into satisfyingly spooky season-long arcs.\\n\\nEach season of *Channel Zero* presents a new terrifying tale in six episodes. Starting with “Candle Cove” in season 1, the show’s future seasons would tackle “No-End House,” “Butcher’s Block,” and “The Dream Door.” Featuring acute attention to detail and truly stunning monster design, each installment of Channel Zero does the near impossible and captures the sensation of being told a properly horrifying campfire story. *– AB*\\n\\n## 8. American Horror Story\\n\\n**Stream on:** Hulu (U.S.), Disney+ (U.K.)\\n\\n*[American Horror Story](https://www.denofgeek.com/american-horror-story/)* never seems to be afraid of going “too far.” While not every season of this anthology series has been a hit amongst fans, its shock factor is part of what makes the show so entertaining. Whether the story is centered around a haunted house, a coven of witches that includes Stevie Nicks, or is an homage to summer camp slasher movies, *American Horror Story* manages to bring something new every season while maintaining its unique, and often twisted, perspective.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this series is that, despite its decade-long run, a casual viewer can jump in at the beginning of almost any season and watch the horror stories that they are interested in without committing to the rest. Although *American Horror Story* definitely isn’t for the squeamish or gore-averse, the series has something for almost every level of horror-fan. *– BA*\\n\\n## 7. Stranger Things\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*[Stranger Things](https://www.denofgeek.com/stranger-things/)* is, quite simply, a juggernaut. By far one of the most successful-ever streaming series and an original that helped put Netflix on the map, this ’80s sci-fi/horror mashup dominates the cultural conversation and the internet’s servers any time a new season is released. One thing that tends to get lost in all the conversations about *Stranger Things*, the phenomenon, is that *Stranger Things*, the TV show, also just happens to be very good.\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [What Stranger Things Can Learn From Game of Thrones’ Ending](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/what-stranger-things-can-learn-from-game-of-thrones-ending/)\\n\\nLike mad TV scientists, creators The Duffer Brothers have crafted the perfect blend of Steph(v)ens Spielberg and King for their nostalgia-soaked epic. Each of the show’s seasons operates like a satisfying game of *Dungeons & Dragons*, with the youthful inhabitants of Hawkins, Indiana putting all of their creativity to use to confront the latest big bad from the Upside Down. Through it all, the show finds plenty of room for genuine scares. By the time [Vecna rolls around in season 4](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/stranger-things-season-4-who-is-vecna/), it’s clear that *Stranger Things* isn’t just a pastiche. It’s proper horror. *– AB*\\n\\n## 6. Les Revenants\\n\\n**Stream on:** AMC+ (U.S.), Sky (U.K.)\\n\\nFast zombies vs. slow zombies? Pah, says *[Les Revenants](https://www.denofgeek.com/les-revenants/)*, existentialist zombies are where it’s at. This French supernatural drama used the concept of people coming back from the grave to explore death and grief, and did so in exquisite style. A beautiful and poignant mystery, it’s set in a small mountain town whose dead suddenly return – some after years, some after decades – without any memory of where they’ve been. Why are they back? How did they die? And how will they live their new afterlives alongside those who loved, buried and grieved for them?\\n\\nWith a choice cast including an unforgettably eerie performance from Swann Nambotin as child returnee Victor, the Canal+ original had an indefinable quality that the English-language adaptation totally failed to capture. From the locations to the photography to the soundtrack by Scottish post-rock bank Mogwai, everything here works. If there’s a more stylishly shot and atmospheric TV show, then we’d like to see it. *– LM*\\n\\n## 5. Midnight Mass\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*[Midnight Mass](https://www.denofgeek.com/midnight-mass/)* just might boast the most creative premise of any horror series on this list. What is that premise exactly? Well, we won’t spoil it on the off-chance that you haven’t heard it yet, dear reader. Speaking obliquely, however, the show takes place on Crockett Island, an isolated community whose already-sparse fishing economic engine has largely dried up. The series opens with the return of a prodigal son from prison, failed venture capitalist Riley Flynn (Zach Gilford), and the arrival of a mysterious stranger, Father Paul Hill (Hamish Linklater), who seems to be capable of great…and supernatural things.\\n\\nThis eight-episode series is [a deeply personal work from horror auteur Mike Flanagan](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/midnight-mass-mike-flanagans-most-personal-work/) (*The Haunting of Hill House*). Drawing from the writer/director’s religious upbringing and struggles with alcoholism, *Midnight Mass* applies the conventions of horror to an intimate story of one little town really going through it. The show will reel you in with its characters and then terrify you with its monstrous twist. *– AB*\\n\\n## 4. Penny Dreadful\\n\\n**Stream on:** Paramount+ (U.S.), Sky (U.K.), Now (U.K.)\\n\\nIf you want horror you might as well go right to the classics. And that’s precisely what Showtime’s *[Penny Dreadful](https://www.denofgeek.com/penny-dreadful/)* offers. Named after a type of lurid 19th century British fiction publication, *Penny Dreadful* puts a whole host of public domain monsters to good use including Dorian Gray, Dracula, and Frankenstein’s monster (with the very talented [Rory Kinnear making the classic role his own](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/bank-of-dave-men-rory-kinnear/)).\\n\\nThe monsters, however, are merely the backdrop for a sprawling narrative that spans three well-received seasons and the *City of Angels* spinoff. Josh Hartnett and Eva Green shine as respective leads Ethan Chandler and Vanessa Ives, who are tasked with resisting forces of the evil and the weird. *– AB*\\n\\n## 3. Hannibal\\n\\n**Stream on:** Prime Video (U.S.), AMC+ (U.K.), Netflix (U.K.), ITVX (U.K.)\\n\\n*[Hannibal](https://www.denofgeek.com/hannibal/)* seemed like a fairly unappealing prospect before it arrived on NBC in 2013. After all, hadn’t we had quite enough of Hannibal Lecter by then? The role had already been recast twice in the movie rollout of Thomas Harris’ acclaimed novels, and simply no one was going to be as good as our beloved Anthony Hopkins, were they? And that weird-lookin’ Danish fella from *Casino Royale* as our favorite psychological game-playin’ cannibal? Pfft, whatever.\\n\\nWell, it turns out that not only was Mads Mikkelsen incredible in the role, but everyone else working on the thriller series was firing on all cylinders, too. *Pushing Daisies* creator Bryan Fuller had lined up a murderer’s row of talent to mold Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and Hannibal’s relationship into a twisted romance for the ages. The show also featured some of the most disturbing visuals ever committed to the small screen. While *Hannibal* may have been canceled after three seasons due to low viewership, the fandom lives on. *– Kirsten Howard*\\n\\n## 2. Black Mirror\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\nPerhaps it’s revealing about our current era that, when English satirist Charlie Brooker set out to create a modern sci-fi/horror anthology a la *The Twilight Zone*, he didn’t have to look much further than his pocket. The name *[Black Mirror](https://www.denofgeek.com/black-mirror/)* invokes those science fiction devices we all carry around that, when turned off, reflect our own dark visage back at us. Thankfully, *Black Mirror* brings a little more to the table than just a “It’s because you’re on that god damn phone” energy.\\n\\n## Read more\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Black Mirror Season 7 Will Do Something the Show Has Never Done Before](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror-season-7-will-do-something-the-show-has-never-done-before/)\\n\\n[TV](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/)\\n\\n### [Why You Should Watch Black Mirror Season 6 in Reverse Order](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/why-you-should-watch-black-mirror-season-6-in-reverse-order/)\\n\\nThis series, which began on Channel 4 before moving over to Netflix, is quite simply one of the best horror efforts of its era. Blessed with Brooker’s cynical creativity and an increasingly impressive roster of talent in front of and behind the camera, every *Black Mirror* story is its own little gift. Like all anthology experiences, some stories are better and scarier than others. But for every [“Mazey Day”](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/black-mirror-review-mazey-day/) misfire there are countless other “White Bear,” “Playtest,” and “USS Callister” classics … and that’s not even to mention the “San Junipero” of it all. Even when *Black Mirro*r isn’t indulging in pure horror, it lets its discomfort with our dismal future infect viewers’ minds. *– AB*\\n\\n## 1. The Haunting of Hill House\\n\\n**Stream on:** Netflix (U.S. and U.K.)\\n\\n*[The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-haunting-of-hill-house/)* is the project that took [Mike Flanagan](https://www.denofgeek.com/mike-flanagan/) from indie horror auteur to streaming spooky season juggernaut. This 10-episode series borrows its name (and little else) from Shirley Jackson’s classic 1959 horror novel. Set in the modern day, it follows the Crain family as they all struggle to deal with the trauma from growing up in a very haunted house.\\n\\nThe most impressive thing about *Hill House* is that it takes already scary concepts (like a cavernous haunted Victorian mansion, a flowery funeral home, or a dingy back alley) and dials the horror up to 11. Yes, haunted houses are usually scary, but under Flanagan’s direction, this one is *really* scary. *The Haunting of Hill House* is the rare episodic endeavor that is able to sustain spooky vibes through 10 hours as well as any 90-minute horror flick. *– AB*\\n\\n* Share:\\n* [Share on Facebook (opens in a new tab)](https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denofgeek.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-best-horror-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century%2F&t=The Best Horror TV Shows of the 21st Century)\\n* [Share on Twitter (opens in a new tab)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denofgeek.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-best-horror-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century%2F&text=The Best Horror TV Shows of the 21st Century)\\n* [Share on Linkedin (opens in a new tab)](https://reddit.com/submit/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denofgeek.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-best-horror-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century%2F&title=The Best Horror TV Shows of the 21st Century)\\n* [Share on email (opens in a new tab)](mailto:?body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denofgeek.com%2Ftv%2Fthe-best-horror-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century%2F%3Futm_source%3Demailshare%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Darticleshare&subject=The Best Horror TV Shows of the 21st Century)\\n\\n|\\n [Comments count:0](#disqus_thread)\\n\\nTags: [Black Mirror](https://www.denofgeek.com/black-mirror/)[Horror](https://www.denofgeek.com/horror/)[Stranger Things](https://www.denofgeek.com/stranger-things/)[The Walking Dead](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-walking-dead/)\\n\\nAd\\n\\n '}],\n",

      "While many TV series nowadays, horror or otherwise, limit themselves to single-digit episode counts and call it quits after a few seasons, *Supernatural* gleefully turned in 327 episodes over the span of 15 seasons. *American Horror Story* never seems to be afraid of going “too far.” While not every season of this anthology series has been a hit amongst fans, its shock factor is part of what makes the show so entertaining. One of the best things about this series is that, despite its decade-long run, a casual viewer can jump in at the beginning of almost any season and watch the horror stories that they are interested in without committing to the rest. By far one of the most successful-ever streaming series and an original that helped put Netflix on the map, this ’80s sci-fi/horror mashup dominates the cultural conversation and the internet’s servers any time a new season is released.\n",

The premise was simple: a zombie virus breaks out in the UK during a series of *Big Brother*, leaving the contestants in the dark about what’s happening until it’s too late.\n",

      "What made *Dead Set* special was the level of detail in both the reality spoof and the horror strand. The involvement of real show presenter Davina McCall, Channel 4 newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and a huge number of former contestants willing to zombie-up and eat some internal organs made it totally convincing. The zombies were also hardcore and responsible for some surprisingly tense and extremely gross moments. Airing over consecutive nights in the run-up to Halloween 2008, it delivered proper zombie gore, cultural comment, and the memorable sight of Andy Nyman as a TV producer screaming obscenities at the dupes he’d exploited while they chewed on his guts and ripped out his spine.

Twenty-five years later, the survivors still struggle with the trauma of what they went through, and the lengths they went to survive.

It\\'s Thursday, December 18. Our fundraiser will soon be over, but we\\'re short of our goal. If you\\'ve lost count of how many times you\\'ve visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it\\'s given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If everyone who finds Wikipedia useful gave $2.75, we\\'d hit our goal in a few hours.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 25 years and Wikipedia is still free. It\\'s still created by people, not machines, and we don\\'t run ads or put up paywalls because we\\'re not here to make a profit off your attention. In other words, it\\'s still the internet we were promised.\\n\\nLess than 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.\\n\\n25 years of the internet at its **best**\\n\\n How often would you like to donate? \\n*   Once \\n*   Monthly \\n*   Annual \\n\\n Support Wikipedia year-round \\n\\n Thanks for your generous support \\n\\nPlease select an amount (USD)\\n\\nThe average donation in the United States is around$13.\\n*   $2.75 \\n*   $15 \\n*   $25 Celebrate & Give 🎉 \\n*   $50 \\n*   $100 \\n*   $250 \\n*   $500 \\n*   Other amount Other \\n\\n- [x] I\\'ll generously add a little to cover the transaction fees so you can keep 100% of my donation. \\n\\n Please select a payment method \\n\\n![Image 4](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/donate/b/be/Trustly_logos_only.png)Online Banking \\n\\nCredit / Debit Card \\n\\nContinue Donate  one time Donate  monthly Donate  annually\\n\\nPlease select an amount (minimum $1)\\n\\nWe cannot accept donations greater than 25000 USD through our website.

These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Problems_of_AI-4)\\n\\n### Reasoning and problem-solving\\n\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical [deductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-15) By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with [uncertain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty \"Uncertainty\") or incomplete information, employing concepts from [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability \"Probability\") and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics \"Economics\").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-16)\\n\\nMany of these [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm \"Algorithm\") are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Intractability_and_efficiency_and_the_combinatorial_explosion-17) Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Psychological_evidence_of_the_prevalence_of_sub-18) Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n### Knowledge representation\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/General_Formal_Ontology.svg/330px-General_Formal_Ontology.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:General_Formal_Ontology.svg)\\n\\nAn ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\\n\\n[Knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation \"Knowledge representation\") and [knowledge engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering \"Knowledge engineering\")[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-19) allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmoliarZhang1994-20) scene interpretation,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeumannM%C3%B6ller2008-21) clinical decision support,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKupermanReichleyBailey2006-22) knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database \"Database\")),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcGarry2005-23) and other areas.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBertiniDel_BimboTorniai2006-24)\\n\\nA [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base \"Knowledge base\") is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) \"Ontology (information science)\") is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021272-25) Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-26) situations, events, states, and time;[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-27) causes and effects;[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-28) knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-29)[default reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_reasoning \"Default reasoning\") (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Default_reasoning-30) and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\n\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of [commonsense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge_(artificial_intelligence) \"Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)\") (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Breadth_of_commonsense_knowledge-31) and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Psychological_evidence_of_the_prevalence_of_sub-18) There is also the difficulty of [knowledge acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition \"Knowledge acquisition\"), the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-34)\\n\\n### Planning and decision-making\\n\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A [rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent \"Rational agent\") has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[[d]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-35)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021528-36) In [automated planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning \"Automated planning\"), the agent has a specific goal.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-37) In [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making \"Automated decision-making\"), the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"[utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility \"Utility\")\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"[expected utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility \"Expected utility\")\": the [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility \"Utility\") of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-38)\\n\\nIn [classical planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling#classical_planning \"Automated planning and scheduling\"), the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-39) In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-40)\\n\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with [inverse reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_reinforcement_learning \"Inverse reinforcement learning\")), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-41)[Information value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_value_theory \"Information value theory\") can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-42) The space of possible future actions and situations is typically [intractably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractably \"Intractably\") large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\n\\nA [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process \"Markov decision process\") has a [transition model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine \"Finite-state machine\") that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#Policy \"Reinforcement learning\") associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_iteration \"Policy iteration\")), be [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic \"Heuristic\"), or it can be learned.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-43)\\n\\n[Game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory \"Game theory\") describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-44)\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-45) It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[[e]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-48)\\n\\n[![Image 12](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png/500px-Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png)\\n\\nIn [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\"), the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\"), the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\\n\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning.

The most common training technique is the [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation \"Backpropagation\") algorithm.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-114) Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and [find patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition \"Pattern recognition\") in data.

Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large [corpus of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_of_text \"Corpus of text\") that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next [token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis \"Lexical analysis\") (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called [reinforcement learning from human feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback \"Reinforcement learning from human feedback\") (RLHF).

There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-238)\\n\\nA 2024 [Goldman Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs \"Goldman Sachs\") Research Paper, _AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge_, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-239) Data centers\\' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-240)\\n\\nIn 2024, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million.[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-241)[Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia \"Nvidia\") CEO [Jensen Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang \"Jensen Huang\") said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-242)\\n\\nIn September 2024, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\") announced an agreement with [Constellation Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_Energy \"Constellation Energy\") to re-open the [Three Mile Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island \"Three Mile Island\") nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission \"Nuclear Regulatory Commission\"). If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US [Inflation Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act \"Inflation Reduction Act\").[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-243) The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the [Palisades Nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station \"Palisades Nuclear Generating Station\") reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of [Exelon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exelon \"Exelon\") who was responsible for Exelon\\'s spinoff of Constellation.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-244)\\n\\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") suspended the approval of data centers north of [Taoyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoyuan,_Taiwan \"Taoyuan, Taiwan\") with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DatacenterDynamics-245) Taiwan aims to [phase out nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_phase-out \"Nuclear power phase-out\") by 2025.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DatacenterDynamics-245) On the other hand, [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore \"Singapore\") imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DatacenterDynamics-245)\\n\\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 [Fukushima nuclear accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_accident \"Fukushima nuclear accident\"), according to an October 2024 _Bloomberg_ article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-bloombergjp-246) Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-bloombergjp-246)\\n\\nOn 1 November 2024, the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Energy_Regulatory_Commission \"Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\") (FERC) rejected an application submitted by [Talen Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talen_Energy \"Talen Energy\") for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station [Susquehanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susquehanna_Steam_Electric_Station \"Susquehanna Steam Electric Station\") to Amazon\\'s data center.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Bloomberg20241104-247) According to the Commission Chairman [Willie L. Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_L._Phillips \"Willie L. Phillips\"), it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Bloomberg20241104-247)\\n\\nIn 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the [greenhouse gas emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions \"Greenhouse gas emissions\") from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but [rebound effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation) \"Rebound effect (conservation)\") (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-248)\\n\\n#### Misinformation\\n\\nSee also: [Content moderation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_moderation \"Content moderation\")\\n\\n[YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\"), [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") and others use [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system \"Recommender system\") to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of [maximizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization \"Mathematical optimization\") user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation \"Misinformation\"), [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theories \"Conspiracy theories\"), and extreme [partisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics) \"Partisan (politics)\") content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubbles \"Filter bubbles\") where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicas2018-249) This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-250) The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-251)\\n\\nIn the early 2020s, [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI \"Generative AI\") began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-252) while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-253)[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-254)[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-255) It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilliams2023-256) one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for [computational propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_propaganda \"Computational propaganda\").[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-257) AI pioneer [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton \"Geoffrey Hinton\") expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorHern2023-258) The ability to influence electorates has been proved in at least one study. This same study shows more inaccurate statements from the models when they advocate for candidates of the political right.[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-259)\\n\\nAI researchers at [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\"), [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\"), universities and other organisations have suggested using \"[personhood credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood#Approaches \"Proof of personhood\")\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-260)\\n\\n#### Algorithmic bias and fairness\\n\\nMain articles: [Algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\") and [Fairness (machine learning)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\")\\n\\nMachine learning applications can be [biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\")[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-262) if they learn from biased data.[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERose2023-263) The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECNA2019-264) Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output.[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-265) Bias can be introduced by the way [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data \"Training data\") is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoffrey200817-266)[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERose2023-263) If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously [harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm \"Harm\") people (as it can in [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity \"Health equity\"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating \"Credit rating\"), [recruitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment \"Recruitment\"), [housing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing \"Public housing\") or [policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policing \"Policing\")) then the algorithm may cause [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination \"Discrimination\").[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-267) The field of [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\") studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\n\\nOn 28 June 2015, [Google Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos \"Google Photos\")\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202025-268) a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021995-269) Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling _anything_ as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrantHill2023-270)\\n\\n[COMPAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software) \"COMPAS (software)\") is a commercial program widely used by [U.S. courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._court \"U.S. court\") to assess the likelihood of a [defendant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant \"Defendant\") becoming a [recidivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivist \"Recidivist\"). In 2016, [Julia Angwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Angwin \"Julia Angwin\") at [ProPublica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica \"ProPublica\") discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELarsonAngwin2016-271) In 2017, several researchers[[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-273) showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-274)\\n\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-275) Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-276)\\n\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as _recommendations_, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-277) Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be _better_ than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-279)\\n\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021995-269)\\n\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is [distributive fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_justice \"Distributive justice\"), which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative [stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype \"Stereotype\") or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with [anti-discrimination laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law \"Anti-discrimination law\").[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Samuel-2022-261)\\n\\nAt its 2022 [Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Conference_on_Fairness,_Accountability,_and_Transparency \"ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\") (ACM FAccT 2022), the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery \"Association for Computing Machinery\"), in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\\\\_dispute#Disputed\\\\_statement \"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Artificial\\\\_intelligence#Dubious \"Talk:Artificial intelligence\")_][[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDockrill2022-280)\\n\\n#### Lack of transparency\\n\\nSee also: [Explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_AI \"Explainable AI\"), [Algorithmic transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_transparency \"Algorithmic transparency\"), and [Right to explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation \"Right to explanation\")\\n\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESample2017-281) Particularly with [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_neural_networks \"Deep neural networks\"), in which there are many non-[linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear \"Linear\") relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-282)\\n\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler \"Ruler\") as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020110-283) Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202088%E2%80%9391-284)\\n\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation.[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-285) Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation \"General Data Protection Regulation\") in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-286) Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight.

This could, as physicist [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking \"Stephen Hawking\") stated, \"[spell the end of the human race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk \"Global catastrophic risk\")\".[[299]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECellan-Jones2014-315) This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[[q]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-317) These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\n\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience \"Sentience\") to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom \"Nick Bostrom\") argued that if one gives _almost any_ goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an [automated paperclip factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer \"Instrumental convergence\") that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips).[[301]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBostrom2014-318)[Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J.

The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like [ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideologies \"Ideologies\"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law \"Law\"), [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government \"Government\"), [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money \"Money\") and the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy \"Economy\") are built on [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language \"Language\"); they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation \"Misinformation\") suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarari2023-321) Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that [modern AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model \"Large language model\") is particularly \"good at persuasion\" and getting better all the time. He asks \"Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion.\"[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStewart2025-322)\\n\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEM%C3%BCllerBostrom2014-323) Personalities such as [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking \"Stephen Hawking\"), [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\"), and [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk \"Elon Musk\"),[[307]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-324) as well as AI pioneers such as [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio \"Yoshua Bengio\"), [Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J.

The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAndersonAnderson2011-337) The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAndersonAnderson2011-337) and was founded at an [AAAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAI \"AAAI\") symposium in 2005.[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAAAI2014-338)\\n\\nOther approaches include [Wendell Wallach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Wallach \"Wendell Wallach\")\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWallach2010-339) and [Stuart J.

This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\nAs a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself[[404]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-430) including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses.[[405]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-431) Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term \\'AI\\' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-432) with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing [buzzword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword \"Buzzword\"), often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[[407]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-433)\\n\\nThere has been debate over whether [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model \"Large language model\") exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by [imitating human text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot \"Stochastic parrot\").[[408]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-434)\\n\\n### Evaluating approaches to AI\\n\\nNo established unifying theory or [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm \"Paradigm\") has guided AI research for most of its history.[[aa]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-436) The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly [sub-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-symbolic \"Sub-symbolic\"), [soft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing \"Soft computing\") and [narrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\"). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\n#### Symbolic AI and its limits\\n\\n[Symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_AI \"Symbolic AI\") (or \"[GOFAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI \"GOFAI\")\")[[410]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaugeland1985112%E2%80%93117-437) simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the [physical symbol systems hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_systems_hypothesis \"Physical symbol systems hypothesis\"): \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[[411]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-438)\\n\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or [commonsense reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning \"Commonsense reasoning\"). [Moravec\\'s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox \"Moravec\\'s paradox\") is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[[412]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-439) Philosopher [Hubert Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus \"Hubert Dreyfus\") had [argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus%27_critique_of_AI \"Dreyfus\\' critique of AI\") since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[[413]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-440) Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[[ab]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-442)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Psychological_evidence_of_the_prevalence_of_sub-18)\\n\\nThe issue is not resolved: [sub-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-symbolic \"Sub-symbolic\") reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\"). Critics such as [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky \"Noam Chomsky\") argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELangley2011-443)[[416]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKatz2012-444) in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from [explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_AI \"Explainable AI\"): it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of [neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI \"Neuro-symbolic AI\") attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\n#### Neat vs. scruffy\\n\\nMain article: [Neats and scruffies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_and_scruffies \"Neats and scruffies\")\\n\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"), [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization \"Optimization\"), or [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\")). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[[417]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-445) but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\n#### Soft vs. hard computing\\n\\nMain article: [Soft computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing \"Soft computing\")\\n\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is [intractable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractability_(complexity) \"Intractability (complexity)\") for many important problems.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Intractability_and_efficiency_and_the_combinatorial_explosion-17) Soft computing is a set of techniques, including [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithms \"Genetic algorithms\"), [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic \"Fuzzy logic\") and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\n#### Narrow vs. general AI\\n\\nMain articles: [Weak artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence \"Weak artificial intelligence\") and [Artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\")\\n\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals.[[418]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPennachinGoertzel2007-446)[[419]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoberts2016-447) General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\n### Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind\\n\\nMain articles: [Philosophy of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence \"Philosophy of artificial intelligence\") and [Artificial consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness \"Artificial consciousness\")\\n\\nThere is no settled consensus in [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind \"Philosophy of mind\") on whether a machine can have a [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind \"Mind\"), [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\") and [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind \"Philosophy of mind\") in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\") and [Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norvig \"Norvig\") add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[[420]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021986-448) However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in [artificial intelligence in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction \"Artificial intelligence in fiction\").\\n\\n#### Consciousness\\n\\nMain articles: [Hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness \"Hard problem of consciousness\") and [Theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind \"Theory of mind\")\\n\\n[David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers \"David Chalmers\") identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChalmers1995-449) The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this _feels_ or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human [information processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing_(psychology) \"Information processing (psychology)\") is easy to explain, human [subjective experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_experience \"Subjective experience\") is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to _know what red looks like_.[[422]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDennett1991-450)\\n\\n#### Computationalism and functionalism\\n\\nMain articles: [Computational theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind \"Computational theory of mind\") and [Functionalism (philosophy of mind)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind) \"Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\")\\n\\nComputationalism is the position in the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind \"Philosophy of mind\") that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem \"Mind–body problem\"). This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [Jerry Fodor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Fodor \"Jerry Fodor\") and [Hilary Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam \"Hilary Putnam\").[[423]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHorst2005-451)\\n\\nPhilosopher [John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle \"John Searle\") characterized this position as \"[strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI_hypothesis \"Strong AI hypothesis\")\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[[ac]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Searle\\'s_strong_AI-455) Searle challenges this claim with his [Chinese room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room \"Chinese room\") argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[[427]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-456)\\n\\n#### AI welfare and rights\\n\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced [AI is sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_AI \"Sentient AI\") (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[[428]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-457) But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[[429]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Thomson-2022-458)[[430]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Kateman-2023-459)[Sapience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience \"Sapience\") (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness \"Self-awareness\")) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[[429]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Thomson-2022-458)[Robot rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_rights \"Robot rights\") are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[[431]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-460)\\n\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[[432]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-461) Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\"), and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.[[433]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-462)[[434]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-463)\\n\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a [moral blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_blindness \"Moral blindness\") analogous to [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery \"Slavery\") or [factory farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming \"Factory farming\"), which could lead to [large-scale suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering_risks \"Suffering risks\") if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[[430]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Kateman-2023-459)[[429]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Thomson-2022-458)\\n\\nFuture\\n------\\n\\n### Superintelligence and the singularity\\n\\nA [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[[419]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoberts2016-447) If research into [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\") produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to [reprogram and improve itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement \"Recursive self-improvement\"). The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what [I. J. Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good \"I. J.

Retrieved 8 December 2023. Instead, the United States has developed a new area of dominance that the rest of the world views with a mixture of awe, envy, and resentment: artificial intelligence... From AI models and research to cloud computing and venture capital, U.S. companies, universities, and research labs – and their affiliates in allied countries – appear to have an enormous lead in both developing cutting-edge AI and commercializing it. The value of U.S. venture capital investments in AI start-ups exceeds that of the rest of the world combined.\\n*   Gertner, Jon.

The [League of Nations](/wiki/League_of_Nations \"League of Nations\") was approved and started operations, but the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") never joined. On 10 January 1920, the League of Nations formally came into being when the [Covenant of the League of Nations](/wiki/Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations \"Covenant of the League of Nations\"), ratified by 42 nations in 1919, took effect.[[5]](#cite_note-6) The League Council acted as an executive body directing the Assembly\\'s business. It began with four permanent members—the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\"), [France](/wiki/France \"France\"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"), and [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\").\\n\\nAfter some limited successes and failures during the 1920s, the League proved ineffective in the 1930s, as it failed to act against the [Japanese invasion of Manchuria](/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria \"Japanese invasion of Manchuria\") in 1933.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*] Forty nations voted for Japan to withdraw from [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\") but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria.[[6]](#cite_note-7) It also failed to act against the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War \"Second Italo-Ethiopian War\"), after the appeal for international intervention by [Ethiopian Emperor](/wiki/Ethiopian_Emperor \"Ethiopian Emperor\") [Haile Selassie I](/wiki/Haile_Selassie \"Haile Selassie\") at Geneva in 1936 went with no avail, including when calls for economic sanctions against Italy failed.

It incorporated Soviet suggestions but included no role for France. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for [religious freedom](/wiki/Religious_freedom \"Religious freedom\"), which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.[[17]](#cite_note-18)[[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESherwood1948447–453-19)\\n\\nRoosevelt\\'s idea of the \"[Four Powers](/wiki/Four_Policemen \"Four Policemen\")\", refers to the four major Allied countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and [China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) \"Republic of China (1912–1949)\"), emerged in the Declaration by the United Nations.[[19]](#cite_note-sheriff-20) On New Year\\'s Day 1942, Roosevelt, Churchill, the Soviet Union\\'s former Foreign Minister [Maxim Litvinov](/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov \"Maxim Litvinov\"), and the Chinese Premier [T.

Bush\") stated in February 2003—referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime—that \"free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society.\"[[231]](#cite_note-235)[[232]](#cite_note-236)[[233]](#cite_note-237)\\n\\nIn 2020, former American President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"), in his memoir *[A Promised Land](/wiki/A_Promised_Land \"A Promised Land\")* noted, \"In the middle of the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"), the chances of reaching any consensus had been slim, which is why the UN had stood idle as [Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary](/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 \"Hungarian Revolution of 1956\") or [U.S. planes dropped napalm on the Vietnamese countryside](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"). Even after the Cold War, divisions within the Security Council continued to hamstring the UN\\'s ability to tackle problems. Its member states lacked either the means or the collective will to reconstruct failing states like [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\"), or prevent an ethnic slaughter in places like Sri Lanka.\"[[234]](#cite_note-238)[[235]](#cite_note-239)\\n\\nSince its founding, there have been many calls for [reform of the UN](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations \"Reform of the United Nations\") but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work.\\n\\n### Representation and structure\\n\\nCore features of the UN apparatus, such as the [veto](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power \"United Nations Security Council veto power\") privileges of some nations in the [Security Council](/wiki/Security_Council \"Security Council\"), are often described as fundamentally undemocratic, contrary to the UN mission, and a main cause of inaction on genocides and [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity \"Crimes against humanity\").[[236]](#cite_note-240)[[237]](#cite_note-241)\\n\\nJacques Fomerand state that the most enduring divide in views of the UN is \"the North–South split\" between [richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_in_the_World \"North–South divide in the World\"). Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically [laissez-faire](/wiki/Laissez-faire \"Laissez-faire\") UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.[[238]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009civ-242)\\n\\nThere have been numerous calls for the [UN Security Council\\'s membership to be increased](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council \"Reform of the United Nations Security Council\"), for different ways of electing the UN\\'s secretary-general, and for a [UN Parliamentary Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly \"United Nations Parliamentary Assembly\") (UNPA).[[239]](#cite_note-243)\\n\\n### Exclusion of nations\\n\\nSee also: [United Nations list of non-self-governing territories](/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories \"United Nations list of non-self-governing territories\") and [List of states with limited recognition](/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition \"List of states with limited recognition\")\\n\\nAfter [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the [French Committee of National Liberation](/wiki/French_Committee_of_National_Liberation \"French Committee of National Liberation\") was late to be recognized by the United States as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. Future French president [Charles de Gaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle \"Charles de Gaulle\") criticized the UN, famously calling it a *machin* (contraption), and was not convinced that a [global security](/wiki/Global_security \"Global security\") alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring [direct defence treaties](/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_France \"Foreign relations of France\") between countries.[[240]](#cite_note-244)\\n\\nFollowing the [Chinese Civil War](/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War \"Chinese Civil War\"), the government of China was disputed between the [Chinese Nationalist Party](/wiki/Kuomintang \"Kuomintang\") and the [Chinese Communist Party](/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party \"Chinese Communist Party\"). After the foundation of the [People\\'s Republic of China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People\\'s Republic of China\") (PRC) on 1 October 1949, the government of the [Republic of China](/wiki/Republic_of_China \"Republic of China\") (ROC) retreated to the island of Taiwan,[[241]](#cite_note-245) continuing to claim that it was the sole government of China. After the civil war, the United Nations continued recognizing the ROC as the [official government of China](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_505_(VI) \"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505 (VI)\"). In 1971, amid growing debate over the representation of the Chinese people on the mainland,[[242]](#cite_note-246) the General Assembly passed [a resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758_(XXVI) \"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI)\") recognizing the PRC as *\"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations.\"*[[243]](#cite_note-247) Critics[*[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")*] allege that this position reflects a failure of the organization\\'s development goals and guidelines,[[244]](#cite_note-248) and it garnered renewed scrutiny during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic \"COVID-19 pandemic\"), when Taiwan was denied membership into the World Health Organization despite its [relatively effective response to the virus](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan \"COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\").[[245]](#cite_note-249) Support for Taiwan\\'s inclusion in the UN remains challenged by the People\\'s Republic of China, which claims the territories controlled by Taiwan [as their own territory](/wiki/One_China \"One China\").[[246]](#cite_note-250)\\n\\n### Independence\\n\\nThroughout the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1950, the Soviet Union boycotted the organization in protest to [China\\'s seat at the UN Security Council](/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations \"China and the United Nations\") being given to the anti-communist [Republic of China](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\"). Three years later, the Soviets effectively forced the resignation of UN Secretary-General [Trygve Lie](/wiki/Trygve_Lie \"Trygve Lie\") by refusing to acknowledge his administration due to his support of the [Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\").[[247]](#cite_note-251)\\n\\nIronically, the United States had simultaneously scrutinized the UN for employing communists and Soviet sympathizers, following a high-profile accusation that [Alger Hiss](/wiki/Alger_Hiss \"Alger Hiss\"), an American who had taken part in the establishment of the UN, had been a Soviet spy. American Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that the [UN Secretariat](/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat \"United Nations Secretariat\") under Secretary-General Lie harboured American communists, leading to further pressure that the UN chief resign.[[248]](#cite_note-252) The United States saw nascent opposition to the UN in the 1960s, particularly amongst conservatives, with groups such as the [John Birch Society](/wiki/John_Birch_Society \"John Birch Society\") stating that the organization was an instrument for communism.[[249]](#cite_note-253) Popular opposition to the UN was expressed through bumper stickers and signs with slogans such as \"Get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.!\" and \"You can\\'t spell communism without U.N.\"[[250]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199572–73,_82-254)\\n\\n### National sovereignty\\n\\nIn the United States, there were concerns about supposed threats to national sovereignty, most notably promoted by the [John Birch Society](/wiki/John_Birch_Society \"John Birch Society\"), which mounted a nationwide campaign in opposition to the UN during the 1960s.[[251]](#cite_note-255)[[252]](#cite_note-256)[[253]](#cite_note-257)\\n\\nBeginning in the 1990s, the same concern appeared with the [American Sovereignty Restoration Act](/wiki/American_Sovereignty_Restoration_Act \"American Sovereignty Restoration Act\"), which has been introduced multiple times in the [United States Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"). In 1997, an amendment containing the bill received a floor vote, with 54 representatives voting in favour.[[254]](#cite_note-258)[[255]](#cite_note-259) The 2007 version of the bill ([H.R.\\xa01146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1146)) was authored by [U.S. Representative](/wiki/U.S._Representative \"U.S. Representative\") [Ron Paul](/wiki/Ron_Paul \"Ron Paul\"), to effect the United States\\' withdrawal from the United Nations. It would repeal various laws pertaining to the UN, terminate authorization for funds to be spent on the UN, terminate UN presence on American property, and withdraw diplomatic immunity for UN employees.[[256]](#cite_note-260) It would provide up to two years for the United States to withdraw.[[257]](#cite_note-lamb-261) The *[Yale Law Journal](/wiki/Yale_Law_Journal \"Yale Law Journal\")* cited the Act as proof that \"the United States\\'s complaints against the United Nations have intensified.\"[[258]](#cite_note-262) The most recent iteration, As of 2022[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Nations&action=edit), is H.R.7806, introduced by [Mike D. Rogers](/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Alabama_politician) \"Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)\").[[259]](#cite_note-263)\\n\\n### Alleged pro-Palestinian bias\\n\\nThe UN\\'s attention to Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians has been considered excessive by Israeli diplomat [Dore Gold](/wiki/Dore_Gold \"Dore Gold\") and pro-Israeli individuals and organisations such as British scholar [Robert S. Wistrich](/wiki/Robert_S._Wistrich \"Robert S. Wistrich\"), American legal scholar [Alan Dershowitz](/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz \"Alan Dershowitz\"), Australian politician [Mark Dreyfus](/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus \"Mark Dreyfus\"), and the [Anti-Defamation League](/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League \"Anti-Defamation League\").[[260]](#cite_note-264) The UNHRC has likewise been accused of anti-Israel bias by Ex-President of the United States [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\"), who complained that the Council focused too much attention on Israel and not enough on adversaries of the US such as Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Iran.[[261]](#cite_note-265) American [state lawmakers](/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) \"State legislature (United States)\") have proposed legislation to block various UN programs deemed to threaten U.S. sovereignty.[[262]](#cite_note-266) In 2023, [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee \"Tennessee\") enacted legislation to block the implementation of programs \"originating in, or traceable to, the United Nations or a subsidiary entity of the United Nations,\" including [Agenda 21](/wiki/Agenda_21 \"Agenda 21\") and [the 2030 Agenda](/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals \"Sustainable Development Goals\").[[263]](#cite_note-267)[[264]](#cite_note-268) In her confirmation hearing before the Senate panel to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, [Elise Stefanik](/wiki/Elise_Stefanik \"Elise Stefanik\"), described the UN\\'s attitude toward Israel as \"anti-semitic\".[[265]](#cite_note-d827-269)[[266]](#cite_note-270)[[267]](#cite_note-271)[[268]](#cite_note-272)\\n\\n### Effectiveness\\n\\nAccording to [international relations](/wiki/International_relations \"International relations\") scholar [Edward Luck](/wiki/Edward_Luck \"Edward Luck\"), the United States has preferred a feeble United Nations in major projects undertaken by the organization to forestall UN interference with, or resistance to, American policies. \"The last thing the U.S. wants is an independent UN throwing its weight around\", Luck said. Similarly, former [US Ambassador to the United Nations](/wiki/US_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations \"US Ambassador to the United Nations\") [Daniel Patrick Moynihan](/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan \"Daniel Patrick Moynihan\") explained that \"The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. The task was given to me, and I carried it forward with not inconsiderable success.\"[[269]](#cite_note-273)\\n\\nIn 1994, former special representative of the secretary-general of the UN to Somalia [Mohamed Sahnoun](/wiki/Mohamed_Sahnoun \"Mohamed Sahnoun\") published *Somalia: The Missed Opportunities*,[[270]](#cite_note-274) a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\"). Sahnoun claims that between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [Siad Barre](/wiki/Siad_Barre \"Siad Barre\") regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by [NGOs](/wiki/NGO \"NGO\"), whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN\\'s excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Sahnoun warned that if radical reform were not undertaken, then the UN would continue to respond to such crises with inept improvisation.[[271]](#cite_note-275)\\n\\nBeyond specific instances or areas of alleged ineffectiveness, some scholars debate the overall effectiveness of the UN. Adherents to the [realist](/wiki/Realism_(international_relations) \"Realism (international relations)\") school of international relations take a pessimistic position, arguing that the UN is not an effective organization because it is dominated and constrained by great powers. [Liberal](/wiki/Liberalism_(international_relations) \"Liberalism (international relations)\") scholars counter that it is an effective organization because it has proved capable of solving many problems by working around the restrictions imposed by powerful member states. The UN is generally considered by scholars to be more effective in realms such as public health, and humanitarian assistance.[[272]](#cite_note-276) The ineffectiveness of enforcing [territorial integrity](/wiki/Territorial_integrity \"Territorial integrity\") in the 21st century[[273]](#cite_note-277) have led to debate on possible re-emergence of the [right of conquest](/wiki/Right_of_conquest \"Right of conquest\").[[274]](#cite_note-278)\\n\\n### Inefficiency and corruption\\n\\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the [Joint Inspection Unit](/wiki/Joint_Inspection_Unit \"Joint Inspection Unit\") to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the United States withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative be introduced. In 1994, the [Office of Internal Oversight Services](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_of_Internal_Oversight_Services \"United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services\") (or the OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[[275]](#cite_note-279)\\n\\nIn 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended [Oil-for-Food Programme](/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme \"Oil-for-Food Programme\") — in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions — had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of [kickbacks](/wiki/Kickback_(bribery) \"Kickback (bribery)\"). An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved in [the scheme](/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Program_Hearings \"Oil-for-Food Program Hearings\"), and raised significant questions about the role of [Kojo Annan](/wiki/Kojo_Annan \"Kojo Annan\"), the son of [Kofi Annan](/wiki/Kofi_Annan \"Kofi Annan\").[[276]](#cite_note-280)\\n\\n## Hymn to the United Nations\\n\\nMain article: [Hymn to the United Nations](/wiki/Hymn_to_the_United_Nations \"Hymn to the United Nations\")\\n\\nOn the request of then United Nations [Secretary-General](/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\") [U Thant](/wiki/U_Thant \"U Thant\"), a Hymn to the United Nations was performed on the occasion of its 26th anniversary, on 24 October 1971, by [Pau Casals](/wiki/Pau_Casals \"Pau Casals\"), the lyrics to which were penned by the poet [W. H. Auden](/wiki/W._H._Auden \"W. H. Auden\").[[277]](#cite_note-281)\\n\\nThant first approached Casals, who was a personal friend, looking to create a hymn to peace and hoping for the song to be based on the preamble of the [Charter of the United Nations](/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations \"Charter of the United Nations\"). Thant later commissioned Auden to write the poem after Casals requested one to set to music. [*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]Auden completed his work in three days time. The finished work, scored for chorus and orchestra, takes approximately seven minutes to play. However, there were never any plans to adopt the song as the organization\\'s official anthem.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n* [Countries portal](/wiki/Portal:Countries \"Portal:Countries\")\\n* [Politics portal](/wiki/Portal:Politics \"Portal:Politics\")\\n* [World portal](/wiki/Portal:World \"Portal:World\")\\n\\n* [International relations](/wiki/International_relations \"International relations\")\\n* [List of country groupings](/wiki/List_of_country_groupings \"List of country groupings\")\\n* [List of current permanent representatives to the United Nations](/wiki/List_of_current_permanent_representatives_to_the_United_Nations \"List of current permanent representatives to the United Nations\")\\n* [List of multilateral free trade agreements](/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements \"List of multilateral free trade agreements\")\\n* [PassBlue](/wiki/Passblue \"Passblue\")\\n* [Spying on the United Nations](/wiki/Spying_on_the_United_Nations \"Spying on the United Nations\")\\n* [United Nations Convention Against Torture](/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture \"United Nations Convention Against Torture\")\\n* [United Nations in popular culture](/wiki/United_Nations_in_popular_culture \"United Nations in popular culture\")\\n* [United Nations Memorial Cemetery](/wiki/United_Nations_Memorial_Cemetery \"United Nations Memorial Cemetery\")\\n* [United Nations television film series](/wiki/United_Nations_television_film_series \"United Nations television film series\")\\n* [World Summit on the Information Society](/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society \"World Summit on the Information Society\")\\n* [2025 Houthi raids on UN buildings in Sanaa](/wiki/2025_Houthi_raids_on_UN_buildings_in_Sanaa \"2025 Houthi raids on UN buildings in Sanaa\")\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-4)** The Holy See is a [sovereign entity](/wiki/Sovereignty \"Sovereignty\") with [statehood](/wiki/State_(polity) \"State (polity)\") over the territory of the [Vatican City State](/wiki/Vatican_City \"Vatican City\").

It\\'s Thursday, December 18. Our fundraiser will soon be over, but we\\'re short of our goal. If you\\'ve lost count of how many times you\\'ve visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it\\'s given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If everyone who finds Wikipedia useful gave $2.75, we\\'d hit our goal in a few hours.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 25 years and Wikipedia is still free. It\\'s still created by people, not machines, and we don\\'t run ads or put up paywalls because we\\'re not here to make a profit off your attention. In other words, it\\'s still the internet we were promised.\\n\\nLess than 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today.

Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-YouTube_gurus-17)\\n\\nKarim said the inspiration for YouTube came from the [Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy \"Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy\") when [Janet Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson \"Janet Jackson\")\\'s breast was briefly exposed by [Justin Timberlake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake \"Justin Timberlake\") during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the [2004 Indian Ocean tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami \"2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\") online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-19) Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an [online dating service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_dating_service \"Online dating service\") and had been influenced by the website [Hot or Not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_or_Not \"Hot or Not\").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-YouTube_gurus-17)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-20) They created posts on [Craigslist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist \"Craigslist\") asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-21) Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site\\'s founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-22)\\n\\n[![Image 19](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Youtube_logo.jpg/250px-Youtube_logo.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Youtube_logo.jpg)\\n\\nThe YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007.

Besides helping to bolster ratings and long-term viewership for _[Saturday Night Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday\\\\_Night\\\\_Live \"Saturday Night Live\")_, \"Lazy Sunday\"\\'s status as an early [viral video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video \"Viral video\") helped establish YouTube as an important website.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-34) Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed when [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal \"NBCUniversal\") requested it two months later based on copyright concerns.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-35) Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube\\'s reach and led to the upload of more third-party content.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-37) The site grew rapidly; in July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#cite_note-38)\\n\\nThe choice of the name `youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `utube.com`.

YouTube co-founder [Jawed Karim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawed_Karim \"Jawed Karim\") referred to the update as \"a stupid idea\", and said that the real reason behind the change was \"not a good one, and not one that will be publicly disclosed.\" He felt that users\\' ability on a social platform to identify harmful content was essential, saying, \"The process works, and there\\'s a name for it: the [wisdom of the crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd \"Wisdom of the crowd\").

Users of ad blockers may be given a pop-up warning saying \"Video player will be blocked after 3 videos\". Users of ad blockers are shown a message asking them to allow ads or inviting them to subscribe to the ad-free [YouTube Premium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Premium \"YouTube Premium\") subscription plan.

It is estimated that up to 27\\xa0million people[[16]](#cite_note-16) viewed the programme in the UK, overtaking radio\\'s audience of 12\\xa0million for the first time.[[17]](#cite_note-17) Those live pictures were fed from 21 cameras in central London to [Alexandra Palace](/wiki/Alexandra_Palace_television_station \"Alexandra Palace television station\") for transmission, and then on to other UK transmitters opened in time for the event.[[18]](#cite_note-18) That year, there were [around two million TV Licences held in the UK](/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom_(historical)#Number_of_licences_issued \"Television licensing in the United Kingdom (historical)\"), rising to over three million the following year, and four and a half million by 1955.[[19]](#cite_note-19)\\n\\n### 1950s\\n\\nTelevision news, although physically separate from its radio counterpart, was still firmly under radio news\\' control in the 1950s. Correspondents provided reports for both outlets, and the first televised bulletin, shown on 5 July 1954 on the then [BBC television service](/wiki/BBC_One \"BBC One\") and presented by [Richard Baker](/wiki/Richard_Baker_(broadcaster) \"Richard Baker (broadcaster)\"), involved his providing narration off-screen while stills were shown.[[20]](#cite_note-20) This was then followed by the customary *Television Newsreel* with a recorded commentary by [John Snagge](/wiki/John_Snagge \"John Snagge\") (and on other occasions by [Andrew Timothy](/wiki/Andrew_Timothy \"Andrew Timothy\")).[[21]](#cite_note-21)\\n\\nOn-screen newsreaders were introduced a year later in 1955\\xa0– [Kenneth Kendall](/wiki/Kenneth_Kendall \"Kenneth Kendall\") (the first to appear in vision), [Robert Dougall](/wiki/Robert_Dougall \"Robert Dougall\"), and [Richard Baker](/wiki/Richard_Baker_(broadcaster) \"Richard Baker (broadcaster)\")—three weeks before [ITN](/wiki/ITN \"ITN\")\\'s launch on 21 September 1955.[[22]](#cite_note-22)\\n\\nMainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in 1950[[23]](#cite_note-23) to larger premises\\xa0– mainly at [Lime Grove Studios](/wiki/Lime_Grove_Studios \"Lime Grove Studios\") in [Shepherd\\'s Bush](/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Bush \"Shepherd\\'s Bush\"), west London\\xa0– taking Current Affairs (then known as Talks Department) with it. It was from here that the first *[Panorama](/wiki/Panorama_(TV_series) \"Panorama (TV series)\")*, a new documentary programme, was transmitted on 11 November 1953, with [Richard Dimbleby](/wiki/Richard_Dimbleby \"Richard Dimbleby\") becoming anchor in 1955.[[24]](#cite_note-24)\\n\\nIn 1958, [Hugh Carleton Greene](/wiki/Hugh_Carleton_Greene \"Hugh Carleton Greene\") became head of News and Current Affairs.[[25]](#cite_note-25)\\n\\n### 1960s\\n\\nOn 1 January 1960, Greene became [Director-General](/wiki/Director_general \"Director general\").[[26]](#cite_note-26) Greene made changes that were aimed at making BBC reporting more similar to its competitor ITN, which had been highly rated by study groups held by Greene.[[27]](#cite_note-27)\\n\\nA newsroom was created at Alexandra Palace, television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts, without having to cover stories for radio too.[[28]](#cite_note-28)\\n\\nOn 20 June 1960, [Nan Winton](/wiki/Nan_Winton \"Nan Winton\"), the first female BBC network newsreader, appeared in vision.[[29]](#cite_note-29) 19 September 1960 saw the start of the radio news and current affairs programme *The Ten O\\'clock News*.[[30]](#cite_note-30) [BBC2](/wiki/BBC_Two \"BBC Two\") started transmission on 20 April 1964 and began broadcasting a new show, *[Newsroom](/wiki/Newsroom_(BBC_programme) \"Newsroom (BBC programme)\")*.[[31]](#cite_note-31)\\n\\n*[The World at One](/wiki/The_World_at_One \"The World at One\")*, a lunchtime news programme, began on 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, and the year before *News Review* had started on television. *News Review* was a summary of the week\\'s news, first broadcast on Sunday, 26 April 1964[[32]](#cite_note-32) on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly *Newsreel Review of the Week*, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition (\"super\") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news [footage](/wiki/Footage \"Footage\"), committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at [Alexandra Palace](/wiki/Alexandra_Palace \"Alexandra Palace\"). The programme ran until the 1980s[[33]](#cite_note-33)\\xa0– by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor\\xa0– to be superseded by [Ceefax](/wiki/Ceefax \"Ceefax\") subtitling (a similar [Teletext](/wiki/Teletext \"Teletext\") format), and the signing of such programmes as *[See Hear](/wiki/See_Hear \"See Hear\")* (from 1981).\\n\\nOn Sunday 17 September 1967, *[The World This Weekend](/wiki/The_World_This_Weekend \"The World This Weekend\")*, a weekly news and current affairs programme, launched on what was then Home Service, but soon-to-be [Radio 4](/wiki/BBC_Radio_4 \"BBC Radio 4\").\\n\\nPreparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on Thursday 7 March 1968 *Newsroom* on BBC2 moved to an early evening slot, becoming the first UK news programme to be transmitted in colour[[34]](#cite_note-34)\\xa0– from Studio A at Alexandra Palace. *News Review* and *Westminster* (the latter a weekly review of [Parliamentary](/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster \"Palace of Westminster\") happenings) were \"colourised\" shortly after.\\n\\nHowever, much of the insert material was still in black and white, as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour [reversal film](/wiki/Reversal_film \"Reversal film\") [stock](/wiki/Film_stock \"Film stock\"), and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one [RCA](/wiki/RCA_Corporation \"RCA Corporation\") colour [Quadruplex videotape](/wiki/Quadruplex_videotape \"Quadruplex videotape\") machine and, eventually two [Pye](/wiki/Pye_Ltd. \"Pye Ltd.\") [plumbicon](/wiki/Diode_gun_Plumbicon#Plumbicon \"Diode gun Plumbicon\") colour [telecines](/wiki/Telecine \"Telecine\")–although the news colour service started with just one.\\n\\nBlack and white national bulletins on BBC 1 continued to originate from Studio B on weekdays, along with *Town and Around*, the London regional \"[opt out](/wiki/Opt_out \"Opt out\")\" programme broadcast throughout the 1960s (and the BBC\\'s first regional news programme for the South East), until it started to be replaced by *[Nationwide](/wiki/Nationwide_(TV_programme) \"Nationwide (TV programme)\")* on Tuesday to Thursday from Lime Grove Studios early in September 1969. *Town and Around* was never to make the move to Television Centre\\xa0– instead it became *London This Week* which aired on Mondays and Fridays only, from the new TVC studios.[[35]](#cite_note-35)\\n\\nThe BBC moved production out of Alexandra Palace in 1969. BBC Television News resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on BBC1\\xa0– in black and white\\xa0– from Television Centre, where it remained until March 2013.[[36]](#cite_note-36)\\n\\nThis move to a smaller studio with better technical facilities allowed *Newsroom* and *News Review* to replace [back projection](/wiki/Back_projection \"Back projection\") with [colour-separation overlay](/wiki/Colour-separation_overlay \"Colour-separation overlay\"). During the 1960s, [satellite communication](/wiki/Communications_satellite \"Communications satellite\") had become possible;[[37]](#cite_note-37) however, it was some years before digital line-store conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly.[[38]](#cite_note-38)\\n\\n### 1970s\\n\\nOn 14 September 1970, the first *[Nine O\\'Clock News](/wiki/BBC_Nine_O%27Clock_News \"BBC Nine O\\'Clock News\")* was broadcast on television. Robert Dougall presented the first week from studio N1[[39]](#cite_note-Dougall-39)\\xa0– described by *[The Guardian](/wiki/The_Guardian \"The Guardian\")*[[40]](#cite_note-bbcnews1-40) as \"a sort of polystyrene padded cell\"[[41]](#cite_note-41)—the bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of 20.50 as a response to the ratings achieved by ITN\\'s *[News at Ten](/wiki/ITV_News_at_Ten \"ITV News at Ten\")*, introduced three years earlier on the rival ITV. Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks, thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid-1950s.\\n\\n[Angela Rippon](/wiki/Angela_Rippon \"Angela Rippon\") became the first female news presenter of the *Nine O\\'Clock News* in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on *The [Morecambe and Wise](/wiki/Morecambe_and_Wise \"Morecambe and Wise\") Christmas Show* in 1976 singing and dancing.[[39]](#cite_note-Dougall-39)\\n\\nThe first edition of *[John Craven](/wiki/John_Craven \"John Craven\")\\'s Newsround*, initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just *[Newsround](/wiki/Newsround \"Newsround\")*, came from studio N3 on 4 April 1972.\\n\\nAfternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the *Nine O\\'Clock News* got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.\\n\\nAlso in the mid-1970s, the late night news on BBC2 was briefly renamed *Newsnight*,[[42]](#cite_note-42) but this was not to last, or be the same programme as we know today\\xa0– that would be launched in 1980\\xa0– and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening BBC2 news expanded to become *Newsday*.\\n\\nNews on radio was to change in the 1970s, and on Radio 4 in particular, brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the *Broadcasting in the Seventies*  report. These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present, as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process. New programmes were also added to the daily schedule, *[PM](/wiki/PM_(Radio_4) \"PM (Radio 4)\")* and *[The World Tonight](/wiki/The_World_Tonight \"The World Tonight\")* as part of the plan for the station to become a \"wholly speech network\".[[40]](#cite_note-bbcnews1-40) *[Newsbeat](/wiki/Newsbeat \"Newsbeat\")* launched as the news service on [Radio 1](/wiki/BBC_Radio_1 \"BBC Radio 1\") on 10 September 1973.[[43]](#cite_note-43)\\n\\nOn 23 September 1974, a [teletext](/wiki/Teletext \"Teletext\") system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The [Ceefax](/wiki/Ceefax \"Ceefax\") service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.\\n\\nBy the end of the decade, the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining, with the introduction of [ENG](/wiki/Electronic_news_gathering \"Electronic news gathering\") technology into the UK. The equipment would gradually become less cumbersome\\xa0– the BBC\\'s first attempts had been using a [Philips](/wiki/Philips \"Philips\") colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable [Sony](/wiki/Sony \"Sony\") [U-matic](/wiki/U-matic \"U-matic\") recorder in the latter half of the decade.\\n\\n### 1980s\\n\\nIn 1980, the [Iranian Embassy Siege](/wiki/Iranian_Embassy_Siege \"Iranian Embassy Siege\") had been shot electronically by the BBC Television News [Outside broadcasting](/wiki/Outside_broadcasting \"Outside broadcasting\") team, and the work of reporter [Kate Adie](/wiki/Kate_Adie \"Kate Adie\"), broadcasting live from [Prince\\'s Gate](/wiki/South_Kensington \"South Kensington\"), was nominated for BAFTA actuality coverage, but this time beaten by ITN for the 1980 award.[[44]](#cite_note-44)\\n\\n*[Newsnight](/wiki/Newsnight \"Newsnight\")*, the news and current affairs programme, was due to go on air on 23 January 1980, although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week.[[45]](#cite_note-bbcnews2-45) On 27 August 1981 [Moira Stuart](/wiki/Moira_Stuart \"Moira Stuart\") became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television.\\n\\nBy 1982, ENG technology had become sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh to use an [Ikegami](/wiki/Ikegami_Tsushinki \"Ikegami Tsushinki\") camera to cover the [Falklands War](/wiki/Falklands_War \"Falklands War\"), coverage for which he won the \"[Royal Television Society](/wiki/Royal_Television_Society \"Royal Television Society\") Cameraman of the Year\" award[[46]](#cite_note-46) and a [BAFTA](/wiki/BAFTA \"BAFTA\") nomination[[47]](#cite_note-47) – the first time that BBC News had relied upon an electronic camera, rather than film, in a conflict zone. BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage,[[48]](#cite_note-48) however the event has become remembered in television terms for [Brian Hanrahan](/wiki/Brian_Hanrahan \"Brian Hanrahan\")\\'s reporting where he coined the phrase \"I\\'m not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back\"[[49]](#cite_note-49) to circumvent restrictions, and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure.[[50]](#cite_note-50)\\n\\nThe first BBC breakfast television programme, *[Breakfast Time](/wiki/Breakfast_Time_(British_TV_programme) \"Breakfast Time (British TV programme)\")* also launched during the 1980s, on 17 January 1983 from Lime Grove Studio E and two weeks before its [ITV](/wiki/ITV_(TV_network) \"ITV (TV network)\") rival [TV-am](/wiki/TV-am \"TV-am\"). [Frank Bough](/wiki/Frank_Bough \"Frank Bough\"), [Selina Scott](/wiki/Selina_Scott \"Selina Scott\"), and [Nick Ross](/wiki/Nick_Ross \"Nick Ross\") helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting.[[51]](#cite_note-51)\\n\\nThe *Six O\\'Clock News* first aired on 3 September 1984, eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 it has been overtaken by the *[BBC News at Ten](/wiki/BBC_News_at_Ten \"BBC News at Ten\")*). In October 1984, images of millions of people starving to death in the [Ethiopian famine](/wiki/1983%E2%80%931985_famine_in_Ethiopia \"1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia\") were shown in [Michael Buerk](/wiki/Michael_Buerk \"Michael Buerk\")\\'s *Six O\\'Clock News* reports.[[52]](#cite_note-BBCLiveAid-52) The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk\\'s report on 23 October describing it as \"a biblical famine in the 20th century\" and \"the closest thing to hell on Earth\".[[53]](#cite_note-53) The BBC News report shocked Britain, motivating its citizens to inundate relief agencies, such as [Save the Children](/wiki/Save_the_Children \"Save the Children\"), with donations, and to bring global attention to the crisis in Ethiopia.[[54]](#cite_note-54) The news report was also watched by [Bob Geldof](/wiki/Bob_Geldof \"Bob Geldof\"), who would organise the charity single \"[Do They Know It\\'s Christmas?](/wiki/Do_They_Know_It%27s_Christmas%3F \"Do They Know It\\'s Christmas?\")\" to raise money for famine relief followed by the [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid \"Live Aid\") concert in July 1985.[[52]](#cite_note-BBCLiveAid-52)\\n\\nStarting in 1981, the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles–a set of computer-animated \"stripes\" forming a circle[[55]](#cite_note-55) on a red background with a \"BBC News\" typescript appearing below the circle graphics, and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards. The *Nine* used a similar (striped) number 9. The red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987.\\n\\nBy 1987, the BBC had decided to re-brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music, the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the *Nine*, although the \"stripes\" introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule.[[56]](#cite_note-56)\\n\\nIn 1987, [John Birt](/wiki/John_Birt,_Baron_Birt \"John Birt, Baron Birt\") resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both TV and radio with the introduction of bi-media journalism.[[57]](#cite_note-57)\\n\\n### 1990s\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News, with the split of [BBC World Service Television](/wiki/BBC_World_Service_Television \"BBC World Service Television\") to become [BBC World](/wiki/BBC_World \"BBC World\") (news and current affairs), and [BBC Prime](/wiki/BBC_Prime \"BBC Prime\") (light entertainment). Content for a 24-hour news channel was thus required, followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent [BBC News 24](/wiki/BBC_News_24 \"BBC News 24\"). Rather than set bulletins, ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary. In 1998, after 66 years at Broadcasting House, the **BBC Radio News** operation moved to [BBC Television Centre](/wiki/BBC_Television_Centre \"BBC Television Centre\").[[58]](#cite_note-58)\\n\\nNew technology, provided by [Silicon Graphics](/wiki/Silicon_Graphics \"Silicon Graphics\"), came into use in 1993 for a re-launch of the main BBC 1 bulletins, creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically. The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring, titles, and music to differentiate each. A computer generated cut-glass sculpture of the [BBC coat of arms](/wiki/BBC_coat_of_arms \"BBC coat of arms\") was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999.\\n\\nIn November 1997, [BBC News Online](/wiki/BBC_News_Online \"BBC News Online\") was launched, following individual webpages for major news events such as the [1996 Olympic Games](/wiki/1996_Olympic_Games \"1996 Olympic Games\"), [1997 general election](/wiki/1997_United_Kingdom_general_election \"1997 United Kingdom general election\"), and the [death of Princess Diana](/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales \"Death of Diana, Princess of Wales\").[[59]](#cite_note-59)\\n\\nIn 1999, the biggest relaunch occurred, with BBC One bulletins, BBC World, BBC News 24, and [BBC News Online](/wiki/BBC_News_Online \"BBC News Online\") all adopting a common style. One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the [BBC regional news programmes](/wiki/Category:BBC_Regional_News_shows \"Category:BBC Regional News shows\"), giving a common style across local, national and international BBC television news. This also included *[Newyddion](/wiki/Newyddion \"Newyddion\")*, the main news programme of [Welsh language](/wiki/Welsh_language \"Welsh language\") channel [S4C](/wiki/S4C \"S4C\"), produced by BBC News Wales.\\n\\n### 2000s\\n\\nFollowing the relaunch of BBC News in 1999, regional headlines were included at the start of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000.[[60]](#cite_note-60) The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55.[[61]](#cite_note-61) 2000 also saw the *Nine O\\'Clock News* moved to the later time of 22:00.[[62]](#cite_note-62) This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular *[News at Ten](/wiki/ITV_News_at_Ten \"ITV News at Ten\")* programme to 23:00.[[63]](#cite_note-63) ITN briefly returned *News at Ten* but following poor ratings when head-to-head against the BBC\\'s *Ten O\\'Clock News*, the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.\\n\\nThe retirement in 2009 of [Peter Sissons](/wiki/Peter_Sissons \"Peter Sissons\")[[64]](#cite_note-64) and departure of [Michael Buerk](/wiki/Michael_Buerk \"Michael Buerk\") from the *Ten O\\'Clock News*[[65]](#cite_note-65) led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The *Six O\\'Clock News* became double headed with [George Alagiah](/wiki/George_Alagiah \"George Alagiah\") and [Sophie Raworth](/wiki/Sophie_Raworth \"Sophie Raworth\") after [Huw Edwards](/wiki/Huw_Edwards_(journalist) \"Huw Edwards (journalist)\") and [Fiona Bruce](/wiki/Fiona_Bruce \"Fiona Bruce\") moved to present the *Ten*. A new set design featuring a projected fictional newsroom backdrop was introduced, followed on 16 February 2004 by new programme titles to match those of BBC News 24.\\n\\nBBC News 24 and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December 2003, that was slightly altered on 5 July 2004 to mark 50 years of BBC Television News.[[66]](#cite_note-66)\\n\\nOn 7 March 2005 director general [Mark Thompson](/wiki/Mark_Thompson_(television_executive) \"Mark Thompson (television executive)\") launched the \"[Creative Futures](/wiki/Creative_Futures_(BBC) \"Creative Futures (BBC)\")\" project to restructure the organisation.[[67]](#cite_note-67)\\n\\nThe individual positions of editor of the *One* and *Six O\\'Clock News* were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while [Craig Oliver](/wiki/Craig_Oliver_(media_executive) \"Craig Oliver (media executive)\") was later named editor of the *Ten O\\'Clock News*.\\n\\nBulletins received new titles and a new set design in May 2006, to allow for *Breakfast* to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997. The new set featured [Barco](/wiki/Barco_NV \"Barco NV\") videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for *Breakfast*. This was later replaced following viewer criticism.[[68]](#cite_note-68) The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced [ITV News](/wiki/ITV_News \"ITV News\") in 2004, though ITN uses a [CSO](/wiki/Colour-separation_overlay \"Colour-separation overlay\") [Virtual studio](/wiki/Virtual_studio \"Virtual studio\") rather than the actual screens at BBC News.\\n\\nBBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November 2006 as part of a restructuring of the BBC. The then-Director of BBC News, [Helen Boaden](/wiki/Helen_Boaden \"Helen Boaden\") reported to the then-Deputy Director-General and head of the journalism group, [Mark Byford](/wiki/Mark_Byford \"Mark Byford\") until he was made redundant in 2010.[[69]](#cite_note-69)\\n\\nOn 18 October 2007, ED Mark Thompson announced a six-year plan, \"Delivering Creative Futures\" (based on his project begun in March 2005), merging the television current affairs department into a new \"News Programmes\" division.[[70]](#cite_note-70)[[71]](#cite_note-71) Thompson\\'s announcement, in response to a £2\\xa0billion shortfall in funding, would, he said, deliver \"a smaller but fitter BBC\" in the digital age, by cutting its payroll and, in 2013, selling [Television Centre](/wiki/BBC_Television_Centre \"BBC Television Centre\").[[72]](#cite_note-72)\\n\\nThe various separate newsrooms for television, radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department. [BBC World Service](/wiki/BBC_World_Service \"BBC World Service\") director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them.[[73]](#cite_note-73)\\n\\nA new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January 2007. This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins, editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on.\\n\\nThe first new BBC News bulletin since the *Six O\\'Clock News* was announced in July 2007 following a successful trial in the Midlands.[[74]](#cite_note-74) The summary, lasting 90 seconds, has been broadcast at 20:00 on weekdays since December 2007 and bears similarities with *[60 Seconds](/wiki/60_Seconds \"60 Seconds\")* on [BBC Three](/wiki/BBC_Three \"BBC Three\"), but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary.\\n\\nAs part of a long-term cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the *BBC News at One*, *Six* and *Ten* respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre.[[75]](#cite_note-75)[[76]](#cite_note-76) BBC World was renamed *BBC World News* and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style, designed by [Lambie-Nairn](/wiki/Lambie-Nairn \"Lambie-Nairn\").[[77]](#cite_note-77)\\n\\n2008 also saw tri-media introduced across TV, radio, and online.[[78]](#cite_note-78)\\n\\nThe studio moves also meant that Studio N9, previously used for BBC World, was closed, and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News 24.

This political objectivity is sometimes questioned. For instance, *[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The Daily Telegraph\")* (3 August 2005) carried a letter from the [KGB](/wiki/KGB \"KGB\") defector [Oleg Gordievsky](/wiki/Oleg_Gordievsky \"Oleg Gordievsky\"), referring to it as \"The Red Service\". Books have been written on the subject, including anti-BBC works like *Truth Betrayed* by W J West and *The Truth Twisters* by Richard Deacon. The BBC has been accused of bias by Conservative MPs.[[126]](#cite_note-126)\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that while \"the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged\", \"the government of the day will often be the primary source of news\".[[127]](#cite_note-BBCEditorialGuidelines-127)\\n\\nThe BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and, by the opposition, of bias in favour of the government. Similarly, during times of war, the BBC is often accused by the UK government, or by strong supporters of British military campaigns, of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy. An edition of *[Newsnight](/wiki/Newsnight \"Newsnight\")* at the start of the [Falklands War](/wiki/Falklands_War \"Falklands War\") in 1982 was described as \"almost treasonable\" by [John Page](/wiki/John_Page_(MP_for_Harrow_West) \"John Page (MP for Harrow West)\"), MP, who objected to [Peter Snow](/wiki/Peter_Snow \"Peter Snow\") saying \"if we believe the British\".[[128]](#cite_note-Falklands_Newsnight-128)\\n\\nDuring the first [Gulf War](/wiki/Gulf_War \"Gulf War\"), critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name \"Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation\".[[129]](#cite_note-news24-129) During the [Kosovo War](/wiki/Kosovo_War \"Kosovo War\"), the BBC were labelled the \"Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation\" (suggesting favouritism towards the [FR Yugoslavia](/wiki/FR_Yugoslavia \"FR Yugoslavia\") government over ethnic [Albanian](/wiki/Albanians \"Albanians\") rebels) by British ministers,[[129]](#cite_note-news24-129) although [Slobodan Milosević](/wiki/Slobodan_Milosevi%C4%87 \"Slobodan Milosević\") (then FRY president) claimed that the BBC\\'s coverage had been biased *against* his nation.[[130]](#cite_note-130)\\n\\nConversely, some of those who style themselves anti-establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro-establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to \"anti-war\" voices. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a study by the Cardiff University School of Journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that, out of the main British broadcasters covering the war, the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties, the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report\\'s author, [Justin Lewis](/wiki/Justin_Lewis_(media_scholar) \"Justin Lewis (media scholar)\"), wrote \"Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis.\"[[131]](#cite_note-131)\\n\\nProminent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of [Greg Dyke](/wiki/Greg_Dyke \"Greg Dyke\") as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, as well as a friend of [Tony Blair](/wiki/Tony_Blair \"Tony Blair\"). The BBC\\'s former Political Editor, [Nick Robinson](/wiki/Nick_Robinson_(journalist) \"Nick Robinson (journalist)\"), was some years ago a chairman of the [Young Conservatives](/wiki/Young_Conservatives_(UK) \"Young Conservatives (UK)\") and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor [Andrew Marr](/wiki/Andrew_Marr \"Andrew Marr\") faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of *[The Independent](/wiki/The_Independent \"The Independent\")*, a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.\\n\\n[Mark Thompson](/wiki/Mark_Thompson_(television_executive) \"Mark Thompson (television executive)\"), former Director-General of the BBC, admitted the organisation has been biased \"towards the left\" in the past. He said, \"In the BBC I joined 30 years ago, there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people\\'s personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left\".[[132]](#cite_note-132) He then added, \"The organization did struggle then with impartiality. Now it is a completely different generation. There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC.\"\\n\\nFollowing the [EU referendum](/wiki/Brexit \"Brexit\") in 2016, some critics suggested that the BBC was biased in favour of leaving the EU. For instance, in 2018, the BBC received complaints from people who took issue that the BBC was not sufficiently covering anti-Brexit marches while giving smaller-scale events hosted by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage more airtime.[[133]](#cite_note-133) On the other hand, a poll released by YouGov showed that 45% of people who voted to leave the EU thought that the BBC was \\'actively anti-Brexit\\' compared to 13% of the same kinds of voters who think the BBC is pro-Brexit.[[134]](#cite_note-134)\\n\\n### India\\n\\nIn 2008, the [BBC Hindi](/wiki/BBC_Hindi \"BBC Hindi\") was criticised by some Indian outlets for referring to the terrorists who carried out the [2008 Mumbai attacks](/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks \"2008 Mumbai attacks\") as \"gunmen\".[[135]](#cite_note-135)[[136]](#cite_note-136) The response to this added to prior criticism from some Indian commentators suggesting that the BBC may have an [Indophobic](/wiki/Indophobic \"Indophobic\") bias.[[137]](#cite_note-137) In March 2015, the BBC was criticised for a BBC [*Storyville*](/wiki/Storyville_(TV_series) \"Storyville (TV series)\") documentary interviewing one of the rapists in India. In spite of a ban ordered by the Indian High court,[[138]](#cite_note-138) the BBC still aired the documentary \"[India\\'s Daughter](/wiki/India%27s_Daughter \"India\\'s Daughter\")\" outside India.\\n\\n### Hutton Inquiry\\n\\nMain article: [Hutton Inquiry](/wiki/Hutton_Inquiry \"Hutton Inquiry\")\\n\\nBBC News was at the centre of a political controversy following the [2003 invasion of Iraq](/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq \"2003 invasion of Iraq\"). Three BBC News reports ([Andrew Gilligan](/wiki/Andrew_Gilligan \"Andrew Gilligan\")\\'s on *[Today](/wiki/Today_programme \"Today programme\")*, Gavin Hewitt\\'s on *The Ten O\\'Clock News* and another on *[Newsnight](/wiki/Newsnight \"Newsnight\")*) quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister\\'s office) had embellished the [September Dossier](/wiki/September_Dossier \"September Dossier\") with misleading exaggerations of Iraq\\'s [weapons of mass destruction](/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction \"Weapons of mass destruction\") capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism.\\n\\nIn subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, [David Kelly](/wiki/David_Kelly_(weapons_expert) \"David Kelly (weapons expert)\") was named in the press as the source for Gilligan\\'s story on 9 July 2003. Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by [Lord Hutton](/wiki/Brian_Hutton,_Baron_Hutton \"Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton\") was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly\\'s death, concluding that \"Dr. Kelly took his own life.\"[[139]](#cite_note-139)\\n\\nIn his report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan\\'s original accusation was \"unfounded\" and the BBC\\'s editorial and management processes were \"defective\". In particular, it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC Director of News, [Richard Sambrook](/wiki/Richard_Sambrook \"Richard Sambrook\"), the report said, had accepted Gilligan\\'s word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete. Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under the chairman\\'s, [Gavyn Davies](/wiki/Gavyn_Davies \"Gavyn Davies\"), guidance, accepted that further investigation of the Government\\'s complaints were unnecessary.\\n\\nBecause of the criticism in the Hutton report, Davies resigned on the day of publication. BBC News faced an important test, reporting on itself with the publication of the report, but by common consent (of the Board of Governors) managed this \"independently, impartially and honestly\".[[140]](#cite_note-140) Davies\\' resignation was followed by the resignation of [Director General](/wiki/Director-General_of_the_BBC \"Director-General of the BBC\"), [Greg Dyke](/wiki/Greg_Dyke \"Greg Dyke\"), the following day, and the resignation of Gilligan on 30 January. While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation, an ICM poll in April 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news.[[141]](#cite_note-141)\\n\\n### Israeli–Palestinian conflict\\n\\nSee also: [Criticism of the BBC §\\xa0Israeli–Palestinian conflict](/wiki/Criticism_of_the_BBC#Israeli–Palestinian_conflict \"Criticism of the BBC\"), and [Balen Report](/wiki/Balen_Report \"Balen Report\")\\n\\nThe BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti-Israel and anti-Palestine bias.\\n\\nDouglas Davis, the London correspondent of *[The Jerusalem Post](/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post \"The Jerusalem Post\")*, has described the BBC\\'s coverage of the [Arab–Israeli conflict](/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict \"Arab–Israeli conflict\") as \"a relentless, one-dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors [which] bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that, wittingly or not, has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half-century.\".[[142]](#cite_note-Davis130-142) However two large independent studies, one conducted by Loughborough University and the other by Glasgow University\\'s Media Group concluded that Israeli perspectives are given greater coverage.[[143]](#cite_note-143)[[144]](#cite_note-144)\\n\\nCritics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming. The *[Daily Mail](/wiki/Daily_Mail \"Daily Mail\")* and *[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph \"The Daily Telegraph\")* criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers\\' pounds from preventing the report being released to the public.[[145]](#cite_note-145)[[146]](#cite_note-146)\\n\\n[Jeremy Bowen](/wiki/Jeremy_Bowen \"Jeremy Bowen\"), the Middle East Editor for BBC world news, was singled out specifically for bias by the [BBC Trust](/wiki/BBC_Trust \"BBC Trust\") which concluded that he violated \"BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality.\"[[147]](#cite_note-ind160409-147)\\n\\nAn independent panel appointed by the [BBC Trust](/wiki/BBC_Trust \"BBC Trust\") was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the BBC\\'s coverage of the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict \"Israeli–Palestinian conflict\").[[148]](#cite_note-148) The panel\\'s assessment was that \"apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias.\" While noting a \"commitment to be fair accurate and impartial\" and praising much of the BBC\\'s coverage the independent panel concluded \"that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict. In some ways the picture is incomplete and, in that sense, misleading.\" It notes that, \"the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, [reflects] the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation\".\\n\\nWriting in the *Financial Times*, [Philip Stephens](/wiki/Philip_Stephens_(journalist) \"Philip Stephens (journalist)\"), one of the panellists, later accused the BBC\\'s director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel\\'s conclusions. He further opined \"My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process. If I am right, the BBC, too, is lost\".[[149]](#cite_note-149) Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day.[[150]](#cite_note-150)\\n\\nThe description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of [Yassir Arafat](/wiki/Yassir_Arafat \"Yassir Arafat\") that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality, particularly from Martin Walker[[151]](#cite_note-Walker-151) in a guest opinion piece in *[The Times](/wiki/The_Times \"The Times\")*, who picked out the apparent case of Fayad Abu Shamala, the [BBC Arabic](/wiki/BBC_Arabic \"BBC Arabic\") Service correspondent, who told a [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas \"Hamas\") rally on 6 May 2001, that journalists in Gaza were \"waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the Palestinian people\".[[151]](#cite_note-Walker-151)\\n\\nWalker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from [Gaza](/wiki/Gaza_City \"Gaza City\") and [Ariel Sharon](/wiki/Ariel_Sharon \"Ariel Sharon\")\\'s stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual.

for 29 consecutive years, from 1993 to 2021, it held the record for most annual U.S. [patents](/wiki/Patent \"Patent\") generated by a business.\\n\\nIBM was founded in 1911 as the [Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company](/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\") (CTR), a [holding company](/wiki/Holding_company \"Holding company\") of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of [punch-card tabulating systems](/wiki/Tabulating_machine \"Tabulating machine\"). During the 1960s and 1970s, the [IBM mainframe](/wiki/IBM_mainframe \"IBM mainframe\"), exemplified by the [System/360](/wiki/IBM_System/360 \"IBM System/360\") and its successors, was the world\\'s dominant [computing platform](/wiki/Computing_platform \"Computing platform\"), with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.[[11]](#cite_note-:0-12) Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large.[[12]](#cite_note-13)\\n\\nIBM debuted in the [microcomputer](/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\") market in 1981 with the [IBM Personal Computer](/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer \"IBM Personal Computer\"); [its architecture](/wiki/PC_architecture \"PC architecture\") remains the basis for the majority of [personal computers](/wiki/Personal_computers \"Personal computers\") sold today.[[13]](#cite_note-14) The company later also found success in the [portable](/wiki/Portable_computer \"Portable computer\") space with the [ThinkPad](/wiki/ThinkPad \"ThinkPad\"). Since the 1990s, IBM has concentrated on [computer services](/wiki/Information_technology \"Information technology\"), [software](/wiki/Software \"Software\"), [supercomputers](/wiki/Supercomputer \"Supercomputer\"), and [scientific research](/wiki/Scientific_method#Scientific_inquiry \"Scientific method\"); it sold its microcomputer division to [Lenovo](/wiki/Lenovo \"Lenovo\") in 2005. IBM continues to develop mainframes, and its supercomputers have [consistently ranked](/wiki/TOP500 \"TOP500\") among the most powerful in the world in the 21st century.\\n\\nAs one of the world\\'s oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several [technological innovations](/wiki/Technological_innovation \"Technological innovation\"), including the [Automated Teller Machine](/wiki/Automated_Teller_Machine \"Automated Teller Machine\") (ATM), [Dynamic Random-Access Memory](/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory \"Dynamic random-access memory\") (DRAM), the [floppy disk](/wiki/Floppy_disk \"Floppy disk\"), [Generalized Markup Language](/wiki/Generalized_Markup_Language \"Generalized Markup Language\"), the [hard disk drive](/wiki/Hard_disk_drive \"Hard disk drive\"), the [magnetic stripe card](/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card \"Magnetic stripe card\"), the [relational database](/wiki/Relational_model \"Relational model\"), the [SQL programming language](/wiki/SQL \"SQL\"), and the [Universal Product Code](/wiki/Universal_Product_Code \"Universal Product Code\") (UPC) barcode. The company has made inroads in advanced [computer chips](/wiki/Integrated_circuit \"Integrated circuit\"), [quantum computing](/wiki/Quantum_computing \"Quantum computing\"), [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\"), and [data infrastructure](/wiki/Data_infrastructure \"Data infrastructure\").[[14]](#cite_note-15)[[15]](#cite_note-16)[[16]](#cite_note-17) IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including six [Nobel Prizes](/wiki/Nobel_Prize \"Nobel Prize\") and six [Turing Awards](/wiki/Turing_Award \"Turing Award\").[[17]](#cite_note-18)\\n\\n## History\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\\n\\nMain article: [History of IBM](/wiki/History_of_IBM \"History of IBM\")\\n\\n### 1910s–1950s\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: 1910s–1950s\")]\\n\\nIBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late 19th century. Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;[[18]](#cite_note-19) Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);[[19]](#cite_note-20) [Herman Hollerith](/wiki/Herman_Hollerith \"Herman Hollerith\") patented the [Electric Tabulating Machine](/wiki/Electric_Tabulating_Machine \"Electric Tabulating Machine\") (1889);[[20]](#cite_note-21) and [Willard Bundy](/wiki/Willard_Bundy \"Willard Bundy\") invented a [time clock](/wiki/Time_clock \"Time clock\") to record workers\\' arrival and departure times on a paper tape (1889).[[21]](#cite_note-22) On June 16, 1911, their four companies were [amalgamated](/wiki/Consolidation_(business) \"Consolidation (business)\") in New York State by [Charles Ranlett Flint](/wiki/Charles_Ranlett_Flint \"Charles Ranlett Flint\") forming a fifth company, the [Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company](/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\") (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.[[1]](#cite_note-certificate1911-1)[[22]](#cite_note-nytimes-23) The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and [Binghamton](/wiki/Binghamton,_New_York \"Binghamton, New York\"), New York; [Dayton, Ohio](/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio \"Dayton, Ohio\"); [Detroit, Michigan](/wiki/Detroit \"Detroit\"); [Washington, D.C.](/wiki/Washington,_D.C. \"Washington, D.C.\"); and [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto \"Toronto\"), Canada.[[23]](#cite_note-24)\\n\\nCollectively, the companies manufactured a wide array of machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. [Thomas J. Watson, Sr.](/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson,_Sr. \"Thomas J. Watson, Sr.\"), fired from the [National Cash Register Company](/wiki/National_Cash_Register_Company \"National Cash Register Company\") (NCR) by [John Henry Patterson](/wiki/John_Henry_Patterson_(NCR_owner) \"John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)\"), called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered a position at CTR.[[24]](#cite_note-Belden-25) Watson joined CTR as general manager and then, 11 months later, was made President when [antitrust](/wiki/Competition_law \"Competition law\") cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.[[25]](#cite_note-26) Having learned Patterson\\'s pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR\\'s companies.[[24]](#cite_note-Belden-25):\\u200a105 He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\".[[26]](#cite_note-Story-27)[[27]](#cite_note-28) His favorite slogan, \"[THINK](/wiki/Think_(slogan) \"Think (slogan)\")\", became a mantra for each company\\'s employees.[[26]](#cite_note-Story-27) During Watson\\'s first four years, revenues reached $9\\xa0million ($163\\xa0million today) and the company\\'s operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.[[26]](#cite_note-Story-27) Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\" and chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\" which had previously been used as the name of CTR\\'s Canadian Division;[[28]](#cite_note-True_story_1962_p.125-29) the name was changed on February 14, 1924.[[29]](#cite_note-30) By 1933, most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.[[30]](#cite_note-31)\\n\\nThe [Nazis](/wiki/Nazi_Party \"Nazi Party\") made extensive use of Hollerith punch card and alphabetical accounting equipment and IBM\\'s majority-owned German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH ([Dehomag](/wiki/Dehomag \"Dehomag\")), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. These census data were used to facilitate the round-up of Jews and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of the [Holocaust](/wiki/Holocaust \"Holocaust\"), including internment in the concentration camps.[[31]](#cite_note-32) Edwin Black contends that IBM\\'s dealings with Nazis through its New York City headquarters persisted during World War II.[[32]](#cite_note-33) Nazi concentration camps operated a Hollerith department called Hollerith Abteilung, which had IBM machines, including calculating and sorting machines.[[33]](#cite_note-34)\\n\\nIBM as a military contractor produced 6% of the [M1 Carbine](/wiki/M1_Carbine \"M1 Carbine\") rifles used in World War II, about 346,500 of them, between August 1943 and May 1944. IBM built the [Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator](/wiki/Automatic_Sequence_Controlled_Calculator \"Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator\"), an electromechanical computer, during World War II. It offered its first commercial stored-program computer, the vacuum tube based [IBM 701](/wiki/IBM_701 \"IBM 701\"), in 1952. The [IBM 305 RAMAC](/wiki/IBM_305_RAMAC \"IBM 305 RAMAC\") introduced the hard disk drive in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the [7000](/wiki/IBM_700/7000_series \"IBM 700/7000 series\") and [1400](/wiki/IBM_1400_series \"IBM 1400 series\") series, beginning in 1958. In which, IBM considered the [1400](/wiki/IBM_1400 \"IBM 1400\") series the \\'\\'model T\\'\\' of computing, because it was the first computer with over ten thousand unit sales by IBM.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]\\n\\nIn 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of [artificial intelligence](/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") when [Arthur L. Samuel](/wiki/Arthur_Samuel_(computer_scientist) \"Arthur Samuel (computer scientist)\") of IBM\\'s [Poughkeepsie](/wiki/Poughkeepsie \"Poughkeepsie\"), New York, laboratory programmed an [IBM 704](/wiki/IBM_704 \"IBM 704\") not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the [FORTRAN](/wiki/FORTRAN \"FORTRAN\") scientific programming language was developed.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]\\n\\n### 1960s–1980s\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: 1960s–1980s\")]\\n\\nIn 1961, IBM developed the [SABRE reservation system](/wiki/Sabre_(travel_reservation_system) \"Sabre (travel reservation system)\") for [American Airlines](/wiki/American_Airlines \"American Airlines\") and introduced the highly successful [Selectric](/wiki/IBM_Selectric \"IBM Selectric\") typewriter. Also in 1961 IBM used the [IBM 7094](/wiki/IBM_7094 \"IBM 7094\") to generate the first song sung completely by a computer using synthesizers. The song was Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two).\\n\\nIn 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of the [Mercury](/wiki/Project_Mercury \"Project Mercury\") astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to [Armonk, New York](/wiki/Armonk,_New_York \"Armonk, New York\"). The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 [Gemini](/wiki/Project_Gemini \"Project Gemini\") flights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission. IBM also developed and manufactured the [Saturn V\\'s](/wiki/Saturn_V \"Saturn V\") Instrument Unit and [Apollo](/wiki/Apollo_program \"Apollo program\") spacecraft guidance computers.\\n\\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family, the [IBM System/360](/wiki/IBM_System/360 \"IBM System/360\"). It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the [IBM System/370](/wiki/IBM_System/370 \"IBM System/370\") in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the [IBM mainframe](/wiki/IBM_mainframe \"IBM mainframe\") the dominant [mainframe computer](/wiki/Mainframe_computer \"Mainframe computer\") and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such as [OS/VS1](/wiki/OS/VS1 \"OS/VS1\") and [MVS](/wiki/MVS \"MVS\"), and the middleware built on top of those such as the [CICS](/wiki/CICS \"CICS\") transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.[[34]](#cite_note-35)\\n\\nIn 1969, the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the [Sherman Antitrust Act](/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act \"Sherman Antitrust Act\") by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM\\'s actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers. Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software. In 1982, the Department of Justice dropped the case as \"without merit\".[[35]](#cite_note-36)\\n\\nAlso in 1969, IBM engineer [Forrest Parry](/wiki/Forrest_Parry \"Forrest Parry\") invented the [magnetic stripe card](/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card \"Magnetic stripe card\") that would become ubiquitous for credit/debit/ATM cards, driver\\'s licenses, rapid transit cards and a multitude of other identity and access control applications. IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards, and for most of the 1970s, the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers. In 1974, IBM engineer [George J. Laurer](/wiki/George_J._Laurer \"George J. Laurer\") developed the [Universal Product Code](/wiki/Universal_Product_Code \"Universal Product Code\").[[36]](#cite_note-37) IBM and the [World Bank](/wiki/World_Bank \"World Bank\") first introduced [financial swaps](/wiki/Swap_(finance) \"Swap (finance)\") to the public in 1981, when they entered into a swap agreement.[[37]](#cite_note-38)\\n\\nIBM entered the [microcomputer](/wiki/Microcomputer \"Microcomputer\") market in the 1980s with the [IBM Personal Computer](/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer \"IBM Personal Computer\") (IBM 5150). The computer, which spawned a [long line of successors](/wiki/List_of_IBM_Personal_Computer_models \"List of IBM Personal Computer models\"), had a profound [influence on the development of the personal computer market](/wiki/Influence_of_the_IBM_PC_on_the_personal_computer_market \"Influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market\") and became one of IBM\\'s best selling products of all time.

It\\'s Thursday, December 18. Our fundraiser will soon be over, but we\\'re short of our goal. If you\\'ve lost count of how many times you\\'ve visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it\\'s given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If everyone who finds Wikipedia useful gave $2.75, we\\'d hit our goal in a few hours.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 25 years and Wikipedia is still free. It\\'s still created by people, not machines, and we don\\'t run ads or put up paywalls because we\\'re not here to make a profit off your attention. In other words, it\\'s still the internet we were promised.\\n\\nLess than 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today.

We manage funds and resources to ensure that every contribution supports our mission.

You can [read our most recent annual report](https://annual.wikimedia.org/) for more information about our financial health. \\n\\n45% Investment in Technology \\nNearly half of our budget goes toward supporting the technology that powers Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. We are constantly working to enhance the user experience for both contributors and readers, improve site security, and ensure reliable access to our websites globally. This infrastructure and product support sustain one of the top ten most visited websites in the world, all at a fraction of the cost of popular for-profit websites.\\n\\n34% Support for Volunteers \\nThe global reach of Wikimedia projects is made possible by the hard work of volunteers from across the globe. We provide grants, legal support, and other resources to help build vibrant volunteer communities. Additionally, we promote community engagement through outreach initiatives and advocate for the growth and protection of free knowledge.\\n\\n12% General and Administrative Expenses \\nOperational costs are essential for the smooth management and governance of the Wikimedia Foundation. These expenses help us recruit top talent and support staff around the world, empowering them to carry out the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation.\\n\\n11% Allocation to Fundraising Efforts \\nDonor support is crucial to sustaining Wikipedia and our other free knowledge endeavors.

At launch, the feature was limited to purchases on [Etsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etsy \"Etsy\") from US users with a payment method linked to their OpenAI account. OpenAI takes an undisclosed cut from the merchant\\'s payment.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-86)[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-87)\\n\\nLimitations\\n-----------\\n\\nChatGPT\\'s training data only covers a period up to the _cut-off date_, so it lacks knowledge of recent events.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-bbcUpdate-88) OpenAI has sometimes mitigated this effect by updating the training data.[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-Whitney-89)[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-Sullivan-2023-90) ChatGPT can find more up-to-date information by searching the web, but this doesn\\'t ensure that responses are accurate, as it may access unreliable or misleading websites.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-bbcUpdate-88)\\n\\nTraining data also suffers from [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\").[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-Perrigo-2022-91) The [reward model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_modeling \"Reward modeling\") of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, in an example of an optimization pathology known as [Goodhart\\'s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law \"Goodhart\\'s law\").[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-92) These limitations may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people.

A 2023 analysis estimated that ChatGPT hallucinates around 3% of the time.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-94) The term \"hallucination\" as applied to LLMs is distinct from [its meaning in psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination \"Hallucination\"), and the phenomenon in chatbots is more similar to [confabulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation \"Confabulation\") or [bullshitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit \"On Bullshit\").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-95)[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-96)\\n\\nIn an article for _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_New\\\\_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_, science fiction writer [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang \"Ted Chiang\") compared ChatGPT and other LLMs to a [lossy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression \"Image compression\")[JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG \"JPEG\") picture:[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-97)\\n\\n> Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way, that a JPEG retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you\\'re looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won\\'t find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it\\'s usually acceptable. [...] It\\'s also a way to understand the \"hallucinations\", or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world. When we think about them this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine percent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated.\\n\\nJournalists and scholars have commented on ChatGPT\\'s tendency to output false information.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-98) When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to \"[Ballad of Dwight Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_of_Dwight_Fry \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\")\", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-Pitt-2022-99)\\n\\n### Jailbreaking\\n\\nSee also: [Prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering \"Prompt engineering\") and [Adversarial machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning \"Adversarial machine learning\")\\n\\nChatGPT is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy.

Over time, users developed variations of the DAN jailbreak, including one such prompt where the chatbot was made to believe it was operating on a points-based system in which points were deducted for rejecting prompts, and that the chatbot would be threatened with termination if it lost all its points.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-102)\\n\\nShortly after ChatGPT\\'s launch, a reporter for the _[Toronto Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto\\\\_Star \"Toronto Star\")_ had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: it was tricked to justify the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine \"2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\"), but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario, it balked at generating arguments that [Canadian Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada \"Prime Minister of Canada\")[Justin Trudeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau \"Justin Trudeau\") is guilty of treason.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-103)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT#cite_note-104)\\n\\n### Cybersecurity\\n\\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Sam_Altman_CropEdit_James_Tamim.jpg/250px-Sam_Altman_CropEdit_James_Tamim.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sam_Altman_CropEdit_James_Tamim.jpg)\\n\\nOpenAI CEO [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman \"Sam Altman\")\\n\\nIn March 2023, a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug \"Software bug\") allowed some users to see the titles of other users\\' conversations.

He argued that [God](/wiki/God_in_Christianity \"God in Christianity\") is the source of the light of natural reason and the light of faith.[[9]](#cite_note-9) He embraced[[10]](#cite_note-SEP3-10) several ideas put forward by [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle \"Aristotle\") and attempted to synthesize [Aristotelian philosophy](/wiki/Aristotelianism \"Aristotelianism\") with the principles of Christianity.[[11]](#cite_note-11) He has been described as \"the most influential thinker of the [medieval period](/wiki/Medieval_period \"Medieval period\")\"[[12]](#cite_note-12) and \"the greatest of the [medieval philosopher](/wiki/Medieval_philosophy \"Medieval philosophy\")-theologians\".[[13]](#cite_note-13) Thomas Aquinas\\'s philosophy influenced modern [virtue ethics](/wiki/Virtue_ethics \"Virtue ethics\"), [aesthetics](/wiki/Aesthetics \"Aesthetics\"), and cognitive theory. He has been criticized, notably by [Bertrand Russell](/wiki/Bertrand_Russell \"Bertrand Russell\"), for seeking to justify conclusions already dictated by faith rather than follow [reason](/wiki/Reason \"Reason\") independently.\\n\\nThomas\\'s best-known works are the unfinished *[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")*, or *Summa Theologiae* (1265–1274), the *[Disputed Questions on Truth](/wiki/Quaestiones_Disputatae_de_Veritate \"Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate\")* (1256–1259) and the *[Summa contra Gentiles](/wiki/Summa_contra_Gentiles \"Summa contra Gentiles\")* (1259–1265).

As a knight in the service of [Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor](/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor \"Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor\"), Landulf of Aquino held the title *[miles](/wiki/Knight \"Knight\")*.[[19]](#cite_note-20) Thomas\\'s mother, Theodora Galluccio, Countess of Teano, belonged to the Rossi branch of the [Neapolitan](/wiki/Naples \"Naples\") Caracciolo family.[[20]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETorrell20053-21) Landulf\\'s brother Sinibald was [abbot](/wiki/Abbot \"Abbot\") of [Monte Cassino](/wiki/Monte_Cassino \"Monte Cassino\"), the oldest [Benedictine](/wiki/Order_of_St._Benedictine \"Order of St. Benedictine\") [monastery](/wiki/Monastery \"Monastery\"). He was the youngest of four sons and had two sisters. While the rest of the family\\'s sons pursued military careers,[[21]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184814-22) the family intended for Thomas to follow his uncle into the abbacy;[[22]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump20033-23) this would have been a normal career path for a younger son of Southern Italian nobility.[[23]](#cite_note-schaff-422-24)\\n\\nAt the age of five, Thomas began his early education at Monte Cassino. After the military conflict between Frederick II and [Pope Gregory IX](/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX \"Pope Gregory IX\") spilt into the abbey in early 1239, Landulf and Theodora had Thomas enrolled at the *[studium generale](/wiki/Studium_generale \"Studium generale\")* ([university](/wiki/University_of_Naples_Federico_II \"University of Naples Federico II\")) established by Frederick in [Naples](/wiki/Naples \"Naples\").[[24]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20041–2-25) There, his teacher in arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music was [Petrus de Ibernia](/wiki/Petrus_de_Ibernia \"Petrus de Ibernia\").[[25]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrabmann19632-26) According to his biographer [Guglielmo Tocco](/wiki/Guglielmo_Tocco \"Guglielmo Tocco\"),[[26]](#cite_note-27)[[27]](#cite_note-28) [Martin of Dacia](/wiki/Martin_of_Dacia \"Martin of Dacia\") was his teacher of grammar and logic.[[28]](#cite_note-Kurian-29) It was at this university that Thomas was presumably introduced to [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle \"Aristotle\"), [Averroes](/wiki/Averroes \"Averroes\") and [Maimonides](/wiki/Maimonides \"Maimonides\"), all of whom would influence his theological philosophy.[[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20042-30) [Peter of Ireland](/wiki/Peter_of_Ireland \"Peter of Ireland\") was teaching the recently translated works of Aristotle as commented on by the Spanish-Arabic philosopher [Averroes](/wiki/Averroes \"Averroes\").[[28]](#cite_note-Kurian-29) During his study at Naples, Thomas also came under the influence of John of St. Julian, a Dominican preacher in Naples, who was part of the active effort by the [Dominican Order](/wiki/Dominican_Order \"Dominican Order\") to recruit devout followers.[[30]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184821–22-31)\\n\\nAt the age of nineteen, Thomas resolved to join the [Dominican Order](/wiki/Dominican_Order \"Dominican Order\"). His change of heart, however, did not please his family.[[31]](#cite_note-32) In an attempt to prevent Theodora\\'s interference in Thomas\\'s choice, the Dominicans arranged to move Thomas to Rome, and from [Rome](/wiki/Rome \"Rome\"), to [Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\").[[32]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184823-33) However, while on his journey to Rome, per Theodora\\'s instructions, his brothers seized him as he was drinking from a spring and took him back to his parents at the castle of [Monte San Giovanni Campano](/wiki/Monte_San_Giovanni_Campano \"Monte San Giovanni Campano\").[[32]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184823-33)\\n\\nThomas was held prisoner for almost one year in the family castles at Monte San Giovanni and Roccasecca in an attempt to prevent him from assuming the Dominican habit and to push him into renouncing his new aspiration.[[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20042-30) Political concerns prevented the Pope from ordering Thomas\\'s release, which had the effect of extending Thomas\\'s detention.[[33]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184824-34) Thomas passed this time of trial tutoring his sisters and communicating with members of the Dominican Order.[[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20042-30)\\n\\nFamily members became desperate to dissuade Thomas, who remained determined to join the Dominicans. At one point, two of his brothers resorted to hiring a prostitute to seduce him, presumably because sexual temptation might dissuade him from a life of [celibacy](/wiki/Celibacy \"Celibacy\"). According to the official records for his canonization, Thomas drove her away wielding a burning log—with which he inscribed a cross onto the wall—and fell into a mystical ecstasy; two angels appeared to him as he slept and said, \"Behold, we gird thee by the command of God with the girdle of chastity, which henceforth will never be imperilled. What human strength can not obtain, is now bestowed upon thee as a celestial gift.\" From then onwards, Thomas was given the grace of perfect chastity by Christ, a girdle he wore till the end of his life. The girdle was given to the ancient monastery of [Vercelli](/wiki/Vercelli \"Vercelli\") in Piedmont, and is now at [Chieri](/wiki/Chieri \"Chieri\"), near [Turin](/wiki/Turin \"Turin\").[[34]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184825-35)[[35]](#cite_note-36)\\n\\nBy 1244, seeing that all her attempts to dissuade Thomas had failed, Theodora sought to save the family\\'s dignity, arranging for Thomas to escape at night through his window. In her mind, a secret escape from detention was less damaging than an open surrender to the Dominicans. Thomas was sent first to Naples and then to Rome to meet [Johannes von Wildeshausen](/wiki/Johannes_von_Wildeshausen \"Johannes von Wildeshausen\"), the [Master General of the Dominican Order](/wiki/Master_General_of_the_Dominican_Order \"Master General of the Dominican Order\").[[36]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184827–28-37)\\n\\n### Paris, Cologne, Albert Magnus, and first Paris regency (1245–1259)\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Paris, Cologne, Albert Magnus, and first Paris regency (1245–1259)\")]\\n\\nIn 1245 Thomas was sent to study at the Faculty of the Arts at the [University of Paris](/wiki/University_of_Paris \"University of Paris\"), where he most likely met Dominican scholar [Albertus Magnus](/wiki/Albertus_Magnus \"Albertus Magnus\"),[[37]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy20032-38) then the holder of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James in Paris.[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHampden184833-39) When Albertus was sent by his superiors to teach at the new *studium generale* at [Cologne](/wiki/Cologne \"Cologne\"), in 1248,[[37]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy20032-38) Thomas followed him, declining [Pope Innocent IV](/wiki/Pope_Innocent_IV \"Pope Innocent IV\")\\'s offer to appoint him abbot of Monte Cassino as a Dominican.[[22]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump20033-23) Albertus then appointed the reluctant Thomas *magister studentium*.[[23]](#cite_note-schaff-422-24) Because Thomas was quiet and did not speak much, some of his fellow students thought he was slow.

He returned to Naples where he was appointed as general preacher by the provincial chapter of 29 September 1260. In September 1261 he was called to [Orvieto](/wiki/Orvieto \"Orvieto\") as conventual lector, where he was responsible for the pastoral formation of the friars unable to attend a *studium generale*. In Orvieto, Thomas completed his *[Summa contra Gentiles](/wiki/Summa_contra_Gentiles \"Summa contra Gentiles\")*, wrote the *[Catena aurea](/wiki/Catena_(biblical_commentary) \"Catena (biblical commentary)\")* (*The Golden Chain*),[[52]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy20034-53) and produced works for [Pope Urban IV](/wiki/Pope_Urban_IV \"Pope Urban IV\") such as the liturgy for the newly created [feast of Corpus Christi](/wiki/Feast_of_Corpus_Christi \"Feast of Corpus Christi\") and the *[Contra errores graecorum](/wiki/Contra_Errores_Graecorum \"Contra Errores Graecorum\")* (*Against the Errors of the Greeks*).[[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20044-46) Some of the hymns that Thomas wrote for the feast of Corpus Christi are still sung today, such as the *[Pange lingua](/wiki/Pange_lingua_gloriosi_corporis_mysterium \"Pange lingua gloriosi corporis mysterium\")* (whose final two verses are the famous *[Tantum ergo](/wiki/Tantum_ergo \"Tantum ergo\")*), and *[Panis angelicus](/wiki/Panis_angelicus \"Panis angelicus\")*. Modern scholarship has confirmed that Thomas was indeed the author of these texts, a point that some had contested.[[53]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETorrell2005129–132-54)\\n\\nIn February 1265 the newly elected [Pope Clement IV](/wiki/Pope_Clement_IV \"Pope Clement IV\") summoned Thomas to Rome to serve as papal theologian. This same year, he was ordered by the Dominican Chapter of Anagni[[54]](#cite_note-55) to teach at the *[studium](/wiki/Medieval_university \"Medieval university\")* *conventuale* at the Roman [convent](/wiki/Convent \"Convent\") of [Santa Sabina](/wiki/Santa_Sabina \"Santa Sabina\"), founded in 1222.[[55]](#cite_note-auto-56) The *studium* at Santa Sabina now became an experiment for the Dominicans, the Order\\'s first *studium provinciale*, an intermediate school between the *studium conventuale* and the *studium generale*. Prior to this time, the Roman Province had offered no specialized education of any sort, no arts, no philosophy; only simple convent schools, with their basic courses in theology for resident friars, were functioning in Tuscany and the meridionale during the first several decades of the order\\'s life. The new *studium provinciale* at Santa Sabina was to be a more advanced school for the province.[[56]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMulchahey1998279-57) [Tolomeo da Lucca](/wiki/Bartholomew_of_Lucca \"Bartholomew of Lucca\"), an associate and early biographer of Thomas, tells us that at the Santa Sabina *studium* Thomas taught the full range of philosophical subjects, both moral and natural.[[57]](#cite_note-58)\\n\\nWhile at the Santa Sabina *studium provinciale*, Thomas began his most famous work, the *[Summa Theologiae](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")*,[[52]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy20034-53) which he conceived specifically suited to beginner students: \"Because a doctor of Catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners. As the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 3:1–2, *as to infants in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat*, our proposed intention in this work is to convey those things that pertain to the Christian religion in a way that is fitting to the instruction of beginners.\"[[58]](#cite_note-59) While there he also wrote a variety of other works like his unfinished *[Compendium Theologiae](/wiki/Compendium_Theologiae_(Aquinas) \"Compendium Theologiae (Aquinas)\")* and *Responsio ad fr. Ioannem Vercellensem de articulis 108 sumptis ex opere Petri de Tarentasia* (*Reply to Brother John of Vercelli Regarding 108 Articles Drawn from the Work of Peter of Tarentaise*).[[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump2003xvii-45)\\n\\nIn his position as head of the *studium*, Thomas conducted a series of important disputations on the power of God, which he compiled into his *De potentia*.[[59]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20045-60) Nicholas Brunacci was among Thomas\\'s students at the Santa Sabina *studium provinciale* and later at the Paris *studium generale*. In November 1268, he was with Thomas and his associate and secretary [Reginald of Piperno](/wiki/Reginald_of_Piperno \"Reginald of Piperno\") as they left Viterbo on their way to Paris to begin the academic year.[[60]](#cite_note-61) Another student of Thomas\\'s at the Santa Sabina *studium provinciale* was [Blessed](/wiki/Beatification \"Beatification\") Tommasello da Perugia.[[61]](#cite_note-62)\\n\\nThomas remained at the *studium* at Santa Sabina from 1265 until he was called back to Paris in 1268 for a second teaching regency.[[59]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20045-60) With his departure for Paris in 1268 and the passage of time, the pedagogical activities of the *studium provinciale* at Santa Sabina were divided between two campuses. A new [convent](/wiki/Convent \"Convent\") of the Order at the Church of [Santa Maria sopra Minerva](/wiki/Santa_Maria_sopra_Minerva \"Santa Maria sopra Minerva\") began in 1255 as a community for women converts but grew rapidly in size and importance after being given over to the Dominicans friars in 1275.[[55]](#cite_note-auto-56) In 1288 the theology component of the provincial curriculum for the education of the friars was relocated from the Santa Sabina *studium provinciale* to the *studium conventuale* at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, which was redesignated as a *studium particularis theologiae*.[[62]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMulchahey1998323-63) This *studium* was transformed in the 16th century into the College of Saint Thomas ([Latin](/wiki/Latin_language \"Latin language\"): *Collegium Divi Thomæ*). In the 20th century, the college was relocated to the convent of [Saints Dominic and Sixtus](/wiki/Santi_Domenico_e_Sisto \"Santi Domenico e Sisto\") and was transformed into the [Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/Pontifical_University_of_Saint_Thomas_Aquinas \"Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas\"), (aka the *Angelicum*).\\n\\n### Quarrelsome second Paris regency (1269–1272)\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Quarrelsome second Paris regency (1269–1272)\")]\\n\\nSee also: [Eternity of the world](/wiki/Eternity_of_the_world \"Eternity of the world\")\\n\\nIn 1268 the Dominican Order assigned Thomas to be regent master at the University of Paris for a second time, a position he held until early 1272. Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of \"[Averroism](/wiki/Averroism \"Averroism\")\" or \"radical [Aristotelianism](/wiki/Aristotelianism \"Aristotelianism\")\" in the universities. Not only was this academic trend controversial, but many thought that Thomas himself might be following Averroes, since Thomas also drew on Aristotle extensively. In response and to distinguish his positions from these perceived errors, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being *De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas* (*On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists*) in which he reprimands Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.[[63]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump200310–11-64) Also during his second regency, he finished the second part of the *Summa* and wrote *De virtutibus* (*On the Virtues*) and *De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes* (*On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers*),[[59]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20045-60) the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian *beginninglessness* of the world.[[64]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump200311–12-65)\\n\\nDisputes with some important [Franciscans](/wiki/Franciscans \"Franciscans\") conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266–67 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, most likely counting him as one of the \"blind leaders of the blind\". [Eleonore Stump](/wiki/Eleonore_Stump \"Eleonore Stump\") says, \"It has also been persuasively argued that Thomas Aquinas\\'s *De aeternitate mundi* was directed in particular against his Franciscan colleague in theology, [John Pecham](/wiki/John_Pecham \"John Pecham\").\"[[64]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump200311–12-65)\\n\\nThomas was deeply disturbed by the spread of Averroism and was angered when he discovered [Siger of Brabant](/wiki/Siger_of_Brabant \"Siger of Brabant\") teaching Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle to Parisian students.[[65]](#cite_note-66) On 10 December 1270, the Bishop of Paris, [Étienne Tempier](/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Tempier \"Étienne Tempier\"), issued an edict condemning thirteen Aristotelian and Averroistic propositions as heretical and excommunicating anyone who continued to support them.[[66]](#cite_note-67) Many in the ecclesiastical community, the so-called [Augustinians](/wiki/Augustinians \"Augustinians\"), were fearful that this introduction of Aristotelianism and the more extreme Averroism might somehow contaminate the purity of the Christian faith. In what appears to be an attempt to counteract the growing fear of Aristotelian thought, Thomas conducted a series of disputations between 1270 and 1272: *De virtutibus in communi* (*On Virtues in General*), *De virtutibus cardinalibus* (*On Cardinal Virtues*), and *De spe* (*On Hope*).[[67]](#cite_note-68)\\n\\n### Late career, cessation of writing, and death (1272–1274)\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Late career, cessation of writing, and death (1272–1274)\")]\\n\\nIn 1272 Thomas took leave from the University of Paris when the Dominicans from his home province called upon him to establish a *studium generale* wherever he liked and staff it as he pleased. He chose to establish the institution in Naples and moved there to take his post as regent master.[[59]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies20045-60) He took his time at Naples to work on the third part of the *Summa* while giving lectures on various religious topics. He also preached to the people of Naples every day in Lent of 1273.

For example, [G. K. Chesterton](/wiki/G._K._Chesterton \"G. K. Chesterton\") wrote that \"His experiences included well-attested cases of levitation in ecstasy; and the Blessed Virgin appeared to him, comforting him with the welcome news that he would never be a Bishop.\"[[69]](#cite_note-70) It is traditionally held that on one occasion, in 1273, at the Dominican convent of Naples in the chapel of [Saint Nicholas](/wiki/Saint_Nicholas \"Saint Nicholas\"),[[70]](#cite_note-71) after [matins](/wiki/Matins \"Matins\"), Thomas lingered and was seen by the [sacristan](/wiki/Sacristan \"Sacristan\") Domenic of Caserta to be levitating in prayer with tears before an icon of the crucified Christ. Christ said to Thomas, \"You have written well of me, Thomas. What reward would you have for your labor?\" Thomas responded, \"Nothing but you, Lord.\"[[71]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEde_ToccoLe_Brun-Gouanvic1996Kennedy1912-72)\\n\\nOn 6 December 1273, another mystical experience took place. While Thomas was celebrating [mass](/wiki/Mass_(liturgy) \"Mass (liturgy)\"), he experienced an unusually long ecstasy.[[72]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy1912-73) Because of what he saw, he abandoned his routine and refused to dictate to his *socius* [Reginald of Piperno](/wiki/Reginald_of_Piperno \"Reginald of Piperno\").

The systematic work of Thomas was valued in part as a foundation for arguing against [early modern philosophers](/wiki/Early_modern_philosophy \"Early modern philosophy\") and \"modernist\" theologians. This movement was given papal support in *[Aeterni Patris](/wiki/Aeterni_Patris \"Aeterni Patris\")*, the 1879 [encyclical](/wiki/Encyclical \"Encyclical\") by [Pope Leo XIII](/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII \"Pope Leo XIII\") stating that Thomas\\'s theology was a definitive exposition of Catholic doctrine. Leo XIII directed the clergy to take the teachings of Thomas as the basis of their theological positions. Leo also decreed that all Catholic seminaries and universities must teach Thomas\\'s doctrines, and where Thomas did not speak on a topic, the teachers were \"urged to teach conclusions that were reconcilable with his thinking.\" Citing [Pope Sixtus V](/wiki/Pope_Sixtus_V \"Pope Sixtus V\"), the encyclical mentions Aquinas and Bonaventure as the \"founders\" of scholastic theology.[[98]](#cite_note-99)\\n\\nIn 1880 Thomas was declared the patron saint of all Catholic educational establishments.[[88]](#cite_note-britannica-250-89)[[99]](#cite_note-100) In 1879 Leo XIII instituted the [Pontifical Academy of Saint Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/Pontifical_Academy_of_Saint_Thomas_Aquinas \"Pontifical Academy of Saint Thomas Aquinas\"), putting into practice *Aeterni Patris* \\' recommendations.[[100]](#cite_note-J._Michael_Miller-101) Similarly, in *[Pascendi Dominici gregis](/wiki/Pascendi_Dominici_gregis \"Pascendi Dominici gregis\")*, the 1907 encyclical by [Pope Pius X](/wiki/Pope_Pius_X \"Pope Pius X\"), the Pope said, \"...let Professors remember that they cannot set St. Thomas aside, especially in metaphysical questions, without grave detriment.\"[[101]](#cite_note-102) On 1 September 1910 Pius X addressed the letter *Sacrorum Antistitum* to all bishops and teachers of religious orders, by which he decreed that the Scholastic philosophy of Thomas was to be \\'established as the foundation of sacred studies\\' for young clerics.[[102]](#cite_note-103) Pius X\\'s 1914 decree *[Postquam sanctissimus](/wiki/Thomism#24_Thomistic_theses_of_Pius_X \"Thomism\")* gave further Vatican endorsement to 24 specific neo-scholastic theses of \"Official Catholic Philosophy\" understood to be rooted in Thomism.[[103]](#cite_note-104)\\n\\nIn response to neo-scholasticism, Catholic scholars who were more sympathetic to modernity gained influence during the early 20th century in the *[nouvelle théologie](/wiki/Nouvelle_th%C3%A9ologie \"Nouvelle théologie\")* movement (meaning \"new theology\"). It was closely associated with a movement of *ressourcement*, meaning \"back to sources\", echoing the phrase \"*[ad fontes](/wiki/Ad_fontes \"Ad fontes\")*\" used by Renaissance humanists. Although *nouvelle théologie* disagreed with neo-scholasticism about modernity, arguing that theology could learn much from modern philosophy and science, their interest in also studying \"old\" sources meant that they found common ground in their appreciation of scholastics like Thomas Aquinas.[[104]](#cite_note-:0-105) The [Second Vatican Council](/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council \"Second Vatican Council\") generally adopted the stance of the theologians of *nouvelle théologie,* but the importance of Thomas was a point of agreement.[[104]](#cite_note-:0-105) The council\\'s decree *[Optatam Totius](/wiki/Optatam_Totius \"Optatam Totius\")* (on the formation of priests, at No. 15), proposed an authentic interpretation of the popes\\' teaching on Thomism, requiring that the theological formation of priests be accomplished with Thomas Aquinas as teacher.[[105]](#cite_note-106)\\n\\nOn 20 November 1974, Paul VI wrote the apostolic letter *Lumen ecclesiae*, inviting the Dominicans to return to the source and rediscover the true doctrine of Thomas.[[106]](#cite_note-107)With 70 quotations, prevalently in the field of [Catholic liturgy](/wiki/Catholic_liturgy \"Catholic liturgy\"), Thomas is one of the most frequently cited authors of the 1997 [Catechism of the Catholic Church](/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\").[[107]](#cite_note-108) General Catholic appreciation for Thomas has remained strong in the 20th century, as seen in the praise offered by [Pope John Paul II](/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II \"Pope John Paul II\") in the 1998 encyclical *[Fides et ratio](/wiki/Fides_et_ratio \"Fides et ratio\"),*[[108]](#cite_note-109)[[109]](#cite_note-110) and similarly in [Pope Benedict XV](/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XV \"Pope Benedict XV\")\\'s 1921 encyclical *Fausto Appetente Die.*[[110]](#cite_note-111)\\n\\n### Modern philosophical influence\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Modern philosophical influence\")]\\n\\nSome modern ethicists within the Catholic Church (notably [Alasdair MacIntyre](/wiki/Alasdair_MacIntyre \"Alasdair MacIntyre\")) and outside it (notably [Philippa Foot](/wiki/Philippa_Foot \"Philippa Foot\")) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas\\'s [virtue ethics](/wiki/Virtue_ethics \"Virtue ethics\") as a way of avoiding [utilitarianism](/wiki/Utilitarianism \"Utilitarianism\") or Kantian \"sense of duty\" (called [deontology](/wiki/Deontology \"Deontology\")).[[111]](#cite_note-112) Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [Elizabeth Anscombe](/wiki/G._E._M._Anscombe \"G.

[Erwin Panofsky](/wiki/Erwin_Panofsky \"Erwin Panofsky\") later would echo these views in *Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism* (1951).[[113]](#cite_note-114)\\n\\nThomas\\'s aesthetic theories, especially the concept of *claritas*, deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [James Joyce](/wiki/James_Joyce \"James Joyce\"), who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among [Western philosophers](/wiki/Western_philosophers \"Western philosophers\"). Joyce refers to Thomas\\'s doctrines in *Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D.

He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but [special pleading](/wiki/Special_pleading \"Special pleading\"). I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.[[117]](#cite_note-118)\\n\\nThis criticism is illustrated with the following example: according to Russell, Thomas advocates the indissolubility of marriage \"on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment.\"[[118]](#cite_note-Russell_1967_462-119) Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, \"No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged\".[[118]](#cite_note-Russell_1967_462-119)\\n\\nIn particular, Thomas pleads that he possesses knowledge of the \"essence\" of God[[119]](#cite_note-120)[*[page\\xa0needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")*] and that this knowledge is not only beyond human reason but is knowledge to which human reason must be \"adapted\".[[120]](#cite_note-121)[*[page\\xa0needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")*]\\n\\n### In arts\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: In arts\")]\\n\\nAccording to [Alfredo Cattabiani](/w/index.php?title=Alfredo_Cattabiani&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Alfredo Cattabiani (page does not exist)\")\\xa0[[it](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Cattabiani \"it:Alfredo Cattabiani\")]:[[121]](#cite_note-122)\\n\\n> An attribute often found in his portraits is a ray of light on the saint\\'s chest or shoulder: often the rays emanate from the book of the Summa that is open on his chest.

For Thomas, the raw material data of this field consists of written [scripture](/wiki/Sacred_Tradition \"Sacred Tradition\") and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, being distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary—or, rather, that the *confluence* of both was necessary—for one to obtain true knowledge of God.[[76]](#cite_note-SEP2-77)\\n\\nThomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas\\'s mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth. The central thought is \"[gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit](/wiki/Gratia_non_tollit_naturam,_sed_perficit \"Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit\")\" (\\'[grace](/wiki/Divine_grace \"Divine grace\") does not destroy nature, but perfects it\\').[[76]](#cite_note-SEP2-77)\\n\\n### Revelation\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Revelation\")]\\n\\nThomas believed that truth is known through reason, rationality ([natural revelation](/wiki/Natural_revelation \"Natural revelation\")) and faith ([supernatural revelation](/wiki/Supernatural_revelation \"Supernatural revelation\")). *Supernatural* revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [Magisterium](/wiki/Magisterium \"Magisterium\"), the sum of which is called \"Tradition\". *Natural* revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.\\n\\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus_Christ \"Jesus Christ\"). The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [Trinity](/wiki/Trinity \"Trinity\"), the [Incarnation](/wiki/Incarnation \"Incarnation\"), and charity are revealed in the teachings of the church and the [scriptures](/wiki/Scripture \"Scripture\") and may not otherwise be deduced.[[123]](#cite_note-124) However, Thomas also makes a distinction between \"demonstrations\" of sacred doctrines and the \"persuasiveness\" of those doctrines.[[124]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-125) The former is akin to something like \"certainty\", whereas the latter is more probabilistic in nature.[[124]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-125)\\n\\nIn other words, Thomas thought Christian doctrines were \"fitting\" to reason (i.e. reasonable), even though they cannot be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.[[124]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-125) In fact, the *[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")* is filled with examples of Thomas arguing that we would expect certain Christian doctrines to be true, even though these expectations are not demonstrative (i.e. \\'fitting\\' or reasonable).[[125]](#cite_note-Iep.utm.edu-126) For example, Thomas argues that we would expect God to become incarnate, and we would expect a resurrected Christ to *not* stay on Earth.[[125]](#cite_note-Iep.utm.edu-126)[[126]](#cite_note-127)\\n\\n#### Reconciling faith and reason\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Reconciling faith and reason\")]\\n\\nAccording to Thomas, faith and reason complement rather than [contradict each other](/wiki/Fideism \"Fideism\"), each giving different views of the same truth. A discrepancy between faith and reason arises from a shortcoming of either natural science or scriptural interpretation. Faith can reveal a divine mystery that eludes scientific observation. On the other hand, science can suggest where fallible humans misinterpret a scriptural metaphor as a literal statement of fact.[[127]](#cite_note-128)\\n\\n### God\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: God\")]\\n\\n[Augustine of Hippo](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo \"Augustine of Hippo\")\\'s reflection on divine essentiality or [essentialist](/wiki/Essentialist \"Essentialist\") theology would influence [Richard of Saint Victor](/wiki/Richard_of_Saint_Victor \"Richard of Saint Victor\"), [Alexander of Hales](/wiki/Alexander_of_Hales \"Alexander of Hales\") and [Bonaventure](/wiki/Bonaventure \"Bonaventure\"). By this method, the [essence](/wiki/Essence \"Essence\") of God is defined by what God is, and also by describing what God is not ([negative theology](/wiki/Negative_theology \"Negative theology\")). Thomas took the text of [Exodus](/wiki/Book_of_Exodus \"Book of Exodus\") beyond the explanation of essential theology. He bridged the gap of understanding between the being of essence and the being of existence. In [Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\"), the way is prepared with the proofs for the existence of God. All that remained was to recognize the God of [Exodus](/wiki/Book_of_Exodus \"Book of Exodus\") as having the nature of \"Him Who is the supreme act of being\". God is simple, there is no composition in God. In this regard, Thomas relied on [Boethius](/wiki/Boethius \"Boethius\") who in turn followed the path of [Platonism](/wiki/Platonism \"Platonism\"), something Thomas usually avoided.[[128]](#cite_note-Gilson,_Etienne_1994,_pp._84-129)\\n\\nThe conclusion was that the meaning of \"I Am Who I Am\" is not an enigma to be answered, but a statement of the essence of God. This is the discovery of Thomas: the essence of God is not described by negative analogy, but the \"essence of God is to exist\". This is the basis of \"[existential theology](/wiki/Existential_theology \"Existential theology\")\" and leads to what Gilson calls the first and only [existential philosophy](/wiki/Existential_philosophy \"Existential philosophy\"). In Latin, this is called *Haec Sublimis Veritas*, \"the sublime truth\". The revealed essence of God is to exist, or in the words of Thomas, \"I am the pure Act of Being\". This has been described as the key to understanding [Thomism](/wiki/Thomism \"Thomism\"). Thomism has been described (as a philosophical movement), as either the emptiest or the fullest of philosophies.[[128]](#cite_note-Gilson,_Etienne_1994,_pp._84-129)\\n\\n### Creation\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Creation\")]\\n\\nFurther information: [Abiogenesis](/wiki/Abiogenesis \"Abiogenesis\") and [Spontaneous generation](/wiki/Spontaneous_generation \"Spontaneous generation\")\\n\\nAs a Catholic, Thomas believed that God was the \"maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible.\" But he thought that this fact can be proved by natural reason; indeed, in showing that it is necessary that any existent being has been created by God, he uses only philosophical arguments, based on his metaphysics of participation.[[129]](#cite_note-130) He also maintains that God creates *ex nihilo*, from nothing, that is he does not make use of any preexisting matter.[[130]](#cite_note-131) On the other hand, Thomas thought that the fact that the world started to exist by God\\'s creation and is not eternal is only known to us by faith; it cannot be proved by natural reason.[[131]](#cite_note-132)\\n\\nLike Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life:\\n\\n> Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated. Hence animals generated from the corruption of inanimate things, or of plants, may have been generated then.[[132]](#cite_note-133)\\n\\nAdditionally, Thomas considered [Empedocles](/wiki/Empedocles \"Empedocles\")\\'s theory that various mutated [species](/wiki/Species \"Species\") emerged at the dawn of Creation. Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [mutations](/wiki/Mutation \"Mutation\") in animal sperm, and argued that they were not unintended by [nature](/wiki/Nature \"Nature\"); rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on Aristotle\\'s *[Physics](/wiki/Physics_(Aristotle) \"Physics (Aristotle)\")*:\\n\\n> The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the \\'ox-progeny\\', i.e., half ox and half-man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved. For they were not generated according to nature, but by the corruption of some natural principle, as it now also happens that some monstrous offspring are generated because of the corruption of seed.[[133]](#cite_note-134)\\n\\n### Nature of God\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Nature of God\")]\\n\\nThomas believed that the [existence of God](/wiki/Existence_of_God \"Existence of God\") is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \"Therefore, I say that this proposition, \"God exists\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject\\xa0... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects.\"[[134]](#cite_note-135)\\n\\nThomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the *Summa Theologiae* and more extensively in the *[Summa contra Gentiles](/wiki/Summa_contra_Gentiles \"Summa contra Gentiles\")*, he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the *[quinque viae](/wiki/Quinque_viae \"Quinque viae\")* (Five Ways).\\n\\n1. Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [First Mover](/wiki/Unmoved_mover \"Unmoved mover\") not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\\n2. Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [First Cause](/wiki/Prima_causa \"Prima causa\"), called God.\\n3. Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\\n4. Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. This then, we call God.[[b]](#cite_note-qualities-136)\\n5. Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. This we call God.[[c]](#cite_note-objects-137)[[135]](#cite_note-138)\\n\\nThomas was receptive to and influenced by [Avicenna](/wiki/Avicenna \"Avicenna\")\\'s [Proof of the Truthful](/wiki/Proof_of_the_Truthful \"Proof of the Truthful\").[[136]](#cite_note-139) Concerning the nature of God, Thomas, like Avicenna felt the best approach, commonly called the *[via negativa](/wiki/Negative_theology \"Negative theology\")*, was to consider what God is not. This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:\\n\\n1. [God is simple](/wiki/Divine_simplicity \"Divine simplicity\"), without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.[[137]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreeft199074–77-140)\\n2. God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God\\'s complete actuality.[[138]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreeft199086–87-141) Thomas defined God as the Ipse [Actus Essendi](/wiki/Actus_Essendi \"Actus Essendi\") subsistens, subsisting act of being.[[139]](#cite_note-142)\\n3. God is infinite. That is, God is not finite in the ways that created beings are physically, intellectually, and emotionally limited. This infinity is to be distinguished from infinity of size and infinity of number.[[140]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreeft199097–99-143)\\n4. God is immutable, incapable of change on the levels of God\\'s essence and character.[[141]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreeft1990105-144)\\n5. God is one, without diversification within God\\'s self. The unity of God is such that God\\'s essence is the same as God\\'s existence. In Thomas\\'s words, \"in itself the proposition \\'God exists\\' is [necessarily true](/wiki/Logical_truth \"Logical truth\"), for in it subject and predicate are the same.\"[[142]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreeft1990111–112-145)\\n\\n### Nature of sin\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: Nature of sin\")]\\n\\nFollowing [Augustine of Hippo](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo \"Augustine of Hippo\"), Thomas defines [sin](/wiki/Sin \"Sin\") as \"a word, deed, or desire, contrary to the [eternal law](/wiki/Divine_law \"Divine law\").\"[[143]](#cite_note-146) It is important to note the analogous nature of law in Thomas\\'s legal philosophy. Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either \"natural law\" (that determined by reason) or \"divine law\" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God\\'s will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one\\'s own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with \"evil\" ([privation](/wiki/Privation \"Privation\") of good, or *[privatio boni](/wiki/Privatio_boni \"Privatio boni\")*[[144]](#cite_note-147)). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God\\'s will for human beings.\\n\\n### Nature of the Trinity\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Nature of the Trinity\")]\\n\\nThomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [Three Interrelated Persons](/wiki/Trinity \"Trinity\"). These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term \"Trinity\" \"does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.\"[[145]](#cite_note-148) The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit \"who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word.\"\\n\\nThis Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [Incarnation](/wiki/Incarnation_(Christianity) \"Incarnation (Christianity)\") of the Word in the person of [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Jesus_Christ \"Jesus Christ\") and through the indwelling of the [Holy Spirit](/wiki/Holy_Spirit_in_Christianity \"Holy Spirit in Christianity\") within those who have experienced [salvation](/wiki/Salvation \"Salvation\") by God; according to Aidan Nichols.[[146]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENichols2002173–174-149)\\n\\n### *Prima causa* (first cause)\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Prima causa (first cause)\")]\\n\\nThomas\\'s five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle\\'s assertions concerning the principles of being. For God as *[prima causa](/wiki/Prima_causa \"Prima causa\")* (\"first cause\") comes from Aristotle\\'s concept of the [unmoved mover](/wiki/Unmoved_mover \"Unmoved mover\") and asserts that God is the ultimate cause of all things.[[147]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENichols200280–82-150)\\n\\n### Nature of Jesus Christ\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section: Nature of Jesus Christ\")]\\n\\nIn the *Summa Theologica,* Thomas begins his discussion of Jesus Christ by recounting the biblical story of [Adam and Eve](/wiki/Adam_and_Eve \"Adam and Eve\") and by describing the negative effects of [original sin](/wiki/Original_sin \"Original sin\"). The purpose of Christ\\'s Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing *the contamination of sin*, which humans cannot do by themselves. \"Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.\"[[148]](#cite_note-151) Thomas argued in favour of the [satisfaction view of atonement](/wiki/Atonement_(satisfaction_view) \"Atonement (satisfaction view)\"); that is, that [Jesus Christ](/wiki/Christian_views_of_Jesus \"Christian views of Jesus\") [died](/wiki/Death_of_Jesus \"Death of Jesus\") \"to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin.\"[[149]](#cite_note-152)\\n\\nThomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [Photinus](/wiki/Photinus \"Photinus\"), Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [Nestorius](/wiki/Nestorius \"Nestorius\"), who suggested that the Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ\\'s existence. However, countering [Apollinaris of Laodicea](/wiki/Apollinaris_of_Laodicea \"Apollinaris of Laodicea\")\\'s views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [soul](/wiki/Soul \"Soul\"), as well. This produced a duality of nature in Christ. Thomas argued against [Eutyches](/wiki/Eutyches \"Eutyches\") that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [Mani](/wiki/Mani_(prophet) \"Mani (prophet)\") and [Valentinus](/wiki/Valentinus_(Gnostic) \"Valentinus (Gnostic)\").[[150]](#cite_note-153)\\n\\nWith respect to [Paul the Apostle](/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle \"Paul the Apostle\")\\'s assertion that Christ, \"though he was in the form of God\\xa0... emptied himself\" ([Philippians](/wiki/Philippians \"Philippians\") 2:6–7) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [kenosis](/wiki/Kenosis \"Kenosis\") that has informed much subsequent Catholic [Christology](/wiki/Christology \"Christology\"). Following the [Council of Nicaea](/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea \"First Council of Nicaea\"), [Augustine of Hippo](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo \"Augustine of Hippo\"), as well as the assertions of Scripture, Thomas held the doctrine of [divine immutability](/wiki/Immutability_(theology) \"Immutability (theology)\").[[151]](#cite_note-154)[[152]](#cite_note-155)[[153]](#cite_note-156) Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas, \"the mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.\"[[154]](#cite_note-157)\\n\\nSimilarly, Thomas explained that Christ \"emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature.\"[[155]](#cite_note-dhspriory.org-158) For Thomas, \"the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty.\"[[155]](#cite_note-dhspriory.org-158) Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ \"emptied himself\" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.\\n\\nIn short, \"Christ had a *real body* of the same nature of ours, a *true rational soul*, and, together with these, *perfect Deity*\". Thus, there is both unity (in his one *[hypostasis](/wiki/Hypostasis_(philosophy) \"Hypostasis (philosophy)\")*) and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.[[156]](#cite_note-159)\\n\\n> I answer that, The Person or hypostasis of Christ may be viewed in two ways. First as it is in itself, and thus it is altogether simple, even as the Nature of the Word. Secondly, in the aspect of person or hypostasis to which it belongs to subsist in a nature; and thus the Person of Christ subsists in two natures. Hence though there is one subsisting being in Him, yet there are different aspects of subsistence, and hence He is said to be a composite person, insomuch as one being subsists in two.[[157]](#cite_note-160)\\n\\nEchoing [Athanasius of Alexandria](/wiki/Athanasius_of_Alexandria \"Athanasius of Alexandria\"), he said that \"The only begotten Son of God\\xa0... assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.\"[[158]](#cite_note-161)\\n\\n### Goal of human life\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: Goal of human life\")]\\n\\nThomas Aquinas identified the goal of human existence as union and eternal fellowship with God. This goal is achieved through the [beatific vision](/wiki/Beatific_vision \"Beatific vision\"), in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.\\n\\nThe goal of union with God has implications for the individual\\'s life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual\\'s [will](/wiki/Free_Will \"Free Will\") must be ordered towards the right things, such as charity, peace, and [holiness](/wiki/Sacred \"Sacred\"). He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature \"because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision].\" Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.[[159]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKreeft1990383-162)\\n\\n### Treatment of heretics\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: Treatment of heretics\")]\\n\\nThomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally *[Ordo Praedicatorum](/wiki/Ordo_Praedicatorum \"Ordo Praedicatorum\")*, the Order of Preachers) which began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [Albigensians](/wiki/Albigensians \"Albigensians\") and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the [Albigensian Crusade](/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade \"Albigensian Crusade\"). In the *Summa Theologiae*, he wrote:\\n\\n> With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death. On the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but \"after the first and second admonition\", as [the Apostle](/wiki/Paul_of_Tarsus \"Paul of Tarsus\") directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.[[160]](#cite_note-163)\\n\\nHeresy was a capital offence against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers\\' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.\\n\\nSimple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offences; Thomas\\'s point seems to be that the gravity of this offence, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas\\'s suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a \"secular tribunal\" rather than [magisterial](/wiki/Magisterium \"Magisterium\") authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics \"deserve\\xa0... death\" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life. For Jews, Thomas argues for toleration of both their persons and their religious rites.[[161]](#cite_note-164)\\n\\n#### Forced baptism of children of Jews and heretics\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=27 \"Edit section: Forced baptism of children of Jews and heretics\")]\\n\\nThe position taken by Thomas was that if children were being reared in error, the Church had no authority to intervene. From *[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")* II-II Q. 10 Art. 12:\\n\\n:   Injustice should be done to no man. Now it would be an injustice to Jews if their children were to be baptized against their will, since they would lose the rights of parental authority over their children as soon as these were Christians. Therefore, these should not be baptized against their parent\\'s will. The custom of the Church has been given very great authority and ought to be jealously observed in all things, since the very doctrine of Catholic Doctors derives its authority from the Church. Hence we ought to abide by the authority of the Church rather than that of an [Augustine](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo \"Augustine of Hippo\") or a [Jerome](/wiki/Jerome \"Jerome\") or any doctor whatever. Now it was never the custom of the Church to baptize the children of Jews against the will of their parents. There are two reasons for this custom. One is on account of the danger to faith. For children baptized before coming into the use of reason, might easily be persuaded by their parents to renounce what they had unknowingly embraced; and this would be detrimental to the faith. The other reason is that it is against natural justice. For a child is by nature part of its father: at first, it is not distinct from its parents as to its body, so long as it is enfolded within the mother\\'s womb and later on after birth, and before it has the use of [free will](/wiki/Free_will \"Free will\"), it is enfolded in the care of its parents, like a spiritual womb. So long as a man does not have the use of reason, he is no different from an irrational animal. Hence, it would be contrary to natural justice, if a child, before coming to the use of reason, were to be taken away from its parent\\'s custody, or anything done against its parent\\'s wish.\\n\\nThe question was again addressed by Thomas in *[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")* III Q. 68 Art. 10:\\n\\n:   It is written in the Decretals (Dist. xiv), quoting the [Council of Toledo](/wiki/Council_of_Toledo \"Council of Toledo\"): In regard to the Jews the holy synod commands that henceforth none of them be forced to believe; for such are not to be saved against their will, but willingly, that their righteousness may be without flaw. Children of non-believers either have the use of reason or they have not. If they have, then they already begin to control their own actions, in things that are of Divine or natural law. And therefore, of their own accord, and against the will of their parents, they can receive Baptism, just as they can contract in marriage. Consequently, such can be lawfully advised and persuaded to be baptized. If, however, they have not yet the use of free-will, according to the natural law they are under the care of their parents as long as they cannot look after themselves. For which reason we say that even the children of the ancients were saved through the faith of their parents.\\n\\nThe issue was discussed in a papal bull by [Pope Benedict XIV](/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XIV \"Pope Benedict XIV\") (1747) where both schools were addressed. The pope noted that the position of Aquinas had been more widely held among theologians and [canon lawyers](/wiki/Canon_lawyers \"Canon lawyers\"), than that of [Duns Scotus](/wiki/Duns_Scotus \"Duns Scotus\").[[162]](#cite_note-165)\\n\\n### Magic and its practitioners\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=28 \"Edit section: Magic and its practitioners\")]\\n\\nRegarding magic, Thomas wrote that:\\n\\n* only God can perform miracles, create and transform.[[163]](#cite_note-166)\\n* angels and demons (\"spiritual substances\") may do wonderful things, but they are not miracles and merely use natural things as instruments.[[164]](#cite_note-167)\\n* any efficacy of magicians does not come from the power of particular words, or celestial bodies, or special figures, or sympathetic magic, but by bidding (ibid., 105)\\n* \"demons\" are intellective substances which were created good and have chosen to be bad, it is these who are bid.[[165]](#cite_note-168)\\n* if there is some transformation that could not occur in nature it is either the demon working on human imagination or arranging a fake.[[166]](#cite_note-169)\\n\\nA mention of witchcraft appears in the *Summa Theologicae*[[167]](#cite_note-170) and concludes that the church does not treat temporary or permanent impotence attributed to a spell any differently to that of natural causes, as far as an impediment to marriage.\\n\\nUnder the *[canon Episcopi](/wiki/Canon_Episcopi \"Canon Episcopi\")*, church doctrine held that witchcraft was not possible and any practitioners of sorcery were deluded and their acts an illusion. Thomas Aquinas was cited in a new doctrine that included the belief in witches. This was a departure from the teachings of his master [Albertus Magnus](/wiki/Albertus_Magnus \"Albertus Magnus\") whose doctrine was based in the *Episcopi*.[[168]](#cite_note-Burr17374-171) \"To what extent Dominican inquisitors such as Heinrich Kramer really found support in Thomas is irrelevant in this context, thus associating Thomas\\'s name with the whole aspect of witchcraft and the persecution of witches.\"[[169]](#cite_note-Haustein-172)\\n\\nThe famous 15th-century witch-hunter\\'s manual, the *[Malleus Maleficarum](/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum \"Malleus Maleficarum\")*, also written by a member of the Dominican Order, begins by quoting Thomas Aquinas refuting the *Episcopi* and goes on to cite Thomas Aquinas over a hundred times.[[170]](#cite_note-173) Promoters of the witch hunts that followed often quoted Thomas more than any other source.[[168]](#cite_note-Burr17374-171) \"Thomas Aquinas\\'s statements remain essentially theoretical and lack any direct relation to the subsequent persecution of witches.\"[[169]](#cite_note-Haustein-172)\\n\\n### Thoughts on the afterlife and resurrection\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=29 \"Edit section: Thoughts on the afterlife and resurrection\")]\\n\\nA grasp of Thomas\\'s psychology is essential for understanding his beliefs about the afterlife and resurrection. Thomas, following church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. The substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is a rational animal.[[171]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump2003194-174) So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter—which allows for the separation of soul from body. Thomas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also comes into existence only in the material body.\\n\\nHuman beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through the continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.[[172]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump2003200-175) Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.\\n\\nResurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet Thomas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the [resurrection of the flesh](/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_flesh \"Resurrection of the flesh\"). Thomas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Thomas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.[[173]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump2003192-176) For Thomas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not *only* spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Thomas\\'s soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.\\n\\nThomas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, \"If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life.\"[[174]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStump2003461,_473-177) Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Thomas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Thomas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine.\\n\\nThomas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Thomas\\'s account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this, he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a [Heaven](/wiki/Heaven \"Heaven\") and [Hell](/wiki/Hell \"Hell\") described in scripture and church [dogma](/wiki/Dogma \"Dogma\"). He also argued the elect in Heaven will be able to look down and witness the suffering of the damned, that they may more rejoice in God. This belief has been used by later critics like [Friedrich Nietzsche](/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche \"Friedrich Nietzsche\"), as coming from a place of hate and resentment. While modern theologians argue it is being misconstrued, and is entirely life affirming, being about God\\'s divine justice and salvation.[[175]](#cite_note-178)\\n\\n##

philosopher.[[176]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJordan2006154-179) He never considered himself a philosopher, and criticized philosophers whom he saw as pagans, for always \"falling short of the true and proper wisdom to be found in Christian revelation\".[[177]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavies200414-180) With this in mind, Thomas did have respect for Aristotle, so much so that in the *Summa*, he often cites Aristotle simply as \"the Philosopher\", a designation frequently used at that time. However, Thomas \"never compromised Christian doctrine by bringing it into line with current Aristotelianism; rather, he modified and corrected the latter whenever it clashed with Christian belief\".[[178]](#cite_note-181)\\n\\nMuch of Thomas\\'s work bears upon philosophical topics, and in this sense may be characterized as philosophical. His philosophical thought has exerted enormous influence on subsequent Christian theology, especially that of the Catholic Church, extending to Western philosophy in general.\\n\\n### Commentaries on Aristotle\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=31 \"Edit section: Commentaries on Aristotle\")]\\n\\nThomas Aquinas wrote several important commentaries on [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle \"Aristotle\")\\'s works, including *[On the Soul](/wiki/On_the_Soul \"On the Soul\")*, *[On Interpretation](/wiki/On_Interpretation \"On Interpretation\")*, *[Posterior Analytics](/wiki/Posterior_Analytics \"Posterior Analytics\")*, *[Nicomachean Ethics](/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics \"Nicomachean Ethics\")*, [*Physics*](/wiki/Physics_(Aristotle) \"Physics (Aristotle)\") and *[Metaphysics](/wiki/Metaphysics_(Aristotle) \"Metaphysics (Aristotle)\")*. His work is associated with [William of Moerbeke](/wiki/William_of_Moerbeke \"William of Moerbeke\")\\'s translations of Aristotle from [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek \"Ancient Greek\") into [Latin](/wiki/Latin \"Latin\").\\n\\n### Epistemology\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=32 \"Edit section: Epistemology\")]\\n\\nSee also: [Double truth](/wiki/Double_truth \"Double truth\")\\n\\nThomas Aquinas believed \"that for the knowledge of any truth whatsoever man needs divine help, that the intellect may be moved by God to its act.\"[[179]](#cite_note-182) However, he believed that human beings have the natural capacity to know many things without special [divine revelation](/wiki/Divine_revelation \"Divine revelation\"), even though such revelation occurs from time to time, \"especially in regard to such (truths) as pertain to faith.\"[[180]](#cite_note-Summa_I-II_Q109a1-183) But this is the light that is given to man by God according to man\\'s nature:\\n\\n> Now every form bestowed on created things by God has power for a determined act[uality], which it can bring about in proportion to its own proper endowment; and beyond which it is powerless, except by a superadded form, as water can only heat when heated by the fire. And thus the human understanding has a form, viz. intelligible light, which of itself is sufficient for knowing certain intelligible things, viz. those we can come to know through the senses.[[180]](#cite_note-Summa_I-II_Q109a1-183)\\n\\n### Ethics\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=33 \"Edit section: Ethics\")]\\n\\nSee also: [Christian ethics](/wiki/Christian_ethics \"Christian ethics\")\\n\\n\"Eternal law\" redirects here. For 2012 fantasy drama series, see [Eternal Law](/wiki/Eternal_Law \"Eternal Law\").\\n\\nThomas was aware that the Albigensians and the Waldensians challenged moral precepts concerning marriage and ownership of private property and that challenges could ultimately be resolved only by logical arguments based on self-evident norms. He accordingly argued, in the Summa Theologiae, that just as the [first principle](/wiki/First_principle \"First principle\") of demonstration is the self-evident principle of noncontradiction (\"the same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time\"), the first principle of action is the self-evident *Bonum* precept (\"good is to be done and pursued and evil avoided\").[[181]](#cite_note-184)\\n\\nThis natural law precept prescribes doing and pursuing what reason knows is good while avoiding evil. Reason knows what is objectively good because good is naturally beneficial and evil is the contrary. To explain goods that are naturally self-evident, Thomas divides them into three categories: substantial goods of self-preservation desired by all; the goods common to both animals and humans, such as procreation and education of offspring; and goods characteristic of rational and intellectual beings, such as living in community and pursuing the truth about God.[[182]](#cite_note-185)\\n\\nTo will such natural goods to oneself and to others is to love. Accordingly, Thomas states that the love precept obligating loving God and neighbour are \"the first general principles of the natural law, and are self-evident to human reason, either through nature or through faith. Wherefore all the precepts of the decalogue are referred to these, as conclusions to general principles.\"[[183]](#cite_note-186)[[184]](#cite_note-187)\\n\\nTo so focus on lovingly willing good is to focus natural law on acting virtuously. In his *Summa Theologiae*, Thomas wrote:\\n\\n> Virtue denotes a certain perfection of a power. Now a thing\\'s perfection is considered chiefly in regard to its end. But the end of power is act. Wherefore power is said to be perfect, according as it is determinate to its act.[[185]](#cite_note-188)\\n\\nThomas emphasized that \"[Synderesis](/wiki/Synderesis \"Synderesis\") is said to be the law of our mind, because it is a habit containing the precepts of the natural law, which are the first principles of human actions.\"[[186]](#cite_note-SEP4-189)[[187]](#cite_note-190)\\n\\nAccording to Thomas,\\n\\n> all acts of virtue are prescribed by the natural law: since each one\\'s reason naturally dictates to him to act virtuously. But if we speak of virtuous acts, considered in themselves, i.e., in their proper species, thus not all virtuous acts are prescribed by the natural law: for many things are done virtuously, to which nature does not incline at first; but that, through the inquiry of reason, have been found by men to be conducive to well living.\\n\\nTherefore, we must determine if we are speaking of virtuous acts as under the aspect of virtuous or as an act in its species.[[188]](#cite_note-Thomas_Aquinas-191)\\n\\nThomas defined the four [cardinal virtues](/wiki/Cardinal_virtues \"Cardinal virtues\") as [prudence](/wiki/Prudence \"Prudence\"), [temperance](/wiki/Temperance_(virtue) \"Temperance (virtue)\"), [justice](/wiki/Justice \"Justice\"), and [fortitude](/wiki/Courage \"Courage\"). The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, and they are binding on everyone. There are, however, three [theological virtues](/wiki/Theological_virtues \"Theological virtues\"): [faith](/wiki/Faith \"Faith\"), [hope](/wiki/Hope \"Hope\"), and [charity](/wiki/Charity_(virtue) \"Charity (virtue)\"). Thomas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) virtues. A perfect virtue is any virtue with charity, charity completes a cardinal virtue. A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God:\\n\\n> Now the object of the theological virtues is God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason. On the other hand, the object of the intellectual and moral virtues is something comprehensible to human reason. Therefore the theological virtues are specifically distinct from the moral and intellectual virtues.[[189]](#cite_note-192)\\n\\nThomas Aquinas wrote \"[Greed] is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.\"[[190]](#cite_note-193)\\n\\nFurthermore, in his *[Treatise on Law](/wiki/Treatise_on_Law \"Treatise on Law\")*, Thomas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, [natural](/wiki/Natural_law \"Natural law\"), human, and [divine](/wiki/Divine_law \"Divine law\"). *Eternal law* is the decree of God that governs all creation: \"That Law which is the Supreme Reason cannot be understood to be otherwise than unchangeable and eternal.\"[[191]](#cite_note-194) *Natural law* is the human \"participation\" in the *eternal law* and is discovered by [reason](/wiki/Reason \"Reason\").[[192]](#cite_note-195) *Natural law* is based on \"[first principles](/wiki/First_principles \"First principles\")\":\\n\\n> this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this..[[193]](#cite_note-196)\\n\\nWhether the natural law contains several precepts, or one only is explained by Thomas, \"All the inclinations of any parts whatsoever of human nature, e.g., of the concupiscible and irascible parts, in so far as they are ruled by reason, belong to the natural law, and are reduced to one first precept, as stated above: so that the precepts of the natural law are many in themselves, but are based on one common foundation.\"[[194]](#cite_note-197)\\n\\nThe desires to live and to procreate are counted by Thomas among those basic (natural) human values on which all human values are based. According to Thomas, all human tendencies are geared towards real human goods. In this case, the human nature in question is marriage, the total gift of oneself to another that ensures a family for children and a future for mankind.[[195]](#cite_note-198) He defined the dual inclination of the action of love: \"towards the good which a man wishes to someone (to himself or to another) and towards that to which he wishes some good\".[[196]](#cite_note-newadvent.org-199)\\n\\nConcerning Human Law, Thomas concludes,\\n\\n> that just as, in the speculative reason, from naturally known indemonstrable principles, we draw the conclusions of the various sciences, the knowledge of which is not imparted to us by nature, but acquired by the efforts of reason, so to it is from the precepts of the natural law, as from general and indemonstrable principles, that human reason needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters. These particular determinations, devised by human reason, are called human laws, provided the other essential conditions of law be observed.\\n\\nHuman law is [positive law](/wiki/Positive_law \"Positive law\"): the natural law applied by governments to societies.[[188]](#cite_note-Thomas_Aquinas-191) Natural and human law is not adequate alone. The need for human behaviour to be directed made it necessary to have Divine law. Divine law is the specially revealed law in the [scriptures](/wiki/Scriptures \"Scriptures\").[[197]](#cite_note-200)\\n\\nThomas also greatly influenced Catholic understandings of [mortal](/wiki/Mortal_sin \"Mortal sin\") and [venial sins](/wiki/Venial_sin \"Venial sin\").\\n\\nThomas refers to animals as *bruta*, non-rational, and that the natural order has declared animals for man\\'s use. Thomas denied that human beings have any duty of charity to animals because they are not persons. Otherwise, it would be unlawful to kill them for food. But humans should still be charitable to them, for \"cruel habits might carry over into our treatment of human beings.\"[[198]](#cite_note-201)[[199]](#cite_note-202)\\n\\nThomas contributed to [economic thought](/wiki/History_of_economic_thought#Economic_thought_in_the_Middle_Ages_(500–1500_AD) \"History of economic thought\") as an aspect of ethics and justice. He dealt with the concept of a [just price](/wiki/Just_price \"Just price\"), normally its market price or a regulated price sufficient to cover seller [costs of production](/wiki/Costs_of_production \"Costs of production\"). He argued it was immoral for sellers to raise their prices simply because buyers were in pressing need of a product.[[200]](#cite_note-203)[[201]](#cite_note-204)\\n\\n### Political order\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=34 \"Edit section: Political order\")]\\n\\nThomas\\'s theory of political order became highly influential. He sees man as a social being who lives in a community and interacts with its other members. That leads, among other things, to the [division of labour](/wiki/Division_of_labour \"Division of labour\").\\n\\nThomas made a distinction between a good man and a good citizen, which was important to the development of [libertarian](/wiki/Libertarian \"Libertarian\") theory. That indicates, in the eyes of the atheist libertarian writer [George H. Smith](/wiki/George_H._Smith \"George H. Smith\"), that the sphere of [individual autonomy](/wiki/Individual_autonomy \"Individual autonomy\") was one which the state could not interfere with.[[202]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith200818-205)\\n\\nThomas thought that monarchy was the best form of government because a monarch does not have to form compromises with other persons. Thomas, however, held that monarchy in only a very specific sense was the best form of government—only when the king was virtuous is it the best form; otherwise if the monarch is vicious it is the worst kind (see De Regno I, Ch. 2). Moreover, according to Thomas, [oligarchy](/wiki/Oligarchy \"Oligarchy\") degenerates more easily into [tyranny](/wiki/Tyranny \"Tyranny\") than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise, the political situation could deteriorate into anarchy, which would be even worse than tyranny. In his political work *[De Regno](/wiki/De_regno,_ad_regem_Cypri \"De regno, ad regem Cypri\")*, Thomas subordinated the political power of the king to the primacy of the divine and human law of [God the creator](/wiki/Creator_deity#Christianity \"Creator deity\"). For example, he affirmed:\\n\\n> Just as the government of a king is the best, so the government of a tyrant is the worst.\\n\\n—\\u200a[\"*De Regno*, Ch. 4, n. 21\"](https://isidore.co/aquinas/DeRegno.htm#4) (in Latin and English).\\n\\n> It is plain, therefore, from what has been said, that a king is one who rules the people of one city or province, and rules them for the common good.\\n\\n—\\u200a[\"*De Regno*, Ch. 2, n. 15\"](https://isidore.co/aquinas/DeRegno.htm#2) (in Latin and English).\\n\\nAccording to Thomas, monarchs are God\\'s representatives in their territories, but the church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and ethics. As a consequence, worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic Church\\'s doctrines and determinations.\\n\\nThomas said slavery was not the natural state of man.[[203]](#cite_note-206) He also held that a slave is by nature equal to his master. He distinguished between \\'natural slavery\\', which is for the benefit of both master and slave, and \\'servile slavery\\', which removes all autonomy from the slave and is, according to Thomas, worse than death.[[204]](#cite_note-207) Aquinas\\' doctrines of the Fair Price,[[205]](#cite_note-208) of the right of [tyrannicide](/wiki/Tyrannicide \"Tyrannicide\") and of the equality of all the baptized sons of God in the [Communion of saints](/wiki/Communion_of_saints \"Communion of saints\") established a limit to the political power to prevent it from degenerating into tyranny. This system had a concern in the Protestant opposition to the Catholic Church and in \"disinterested\" replies to Thomism carried out by [Immanuel Kant](/wiki/Immanuel_Kant \"Immanuel Kant\") and [Baruch Spinoza](/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza \"Baruch Spinoza\").\\n\\n#### Death penalty\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=35 \"Edit section: Death penalty\")]\\n\\nIn [Summa Contra Gentiles](/wiki/Summa_Contra_Gentiles \"Summa Contra Gentiles\"), Book 3, Chapter 146, which was written by Thomas prior to writing the *[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica \"Summa Theologica\")*, Thomas allowed the judicial [death penalty](/wiki/Death_penalty \"Death penalty\"). He stated:[[206]](#cite_note-209)\\n\\n> [M]en who are in authority over others do no wrong when they reward the good and punish the evil.\\n>\\n> [...] for the preservation of concord among men it is necessary that punishments be inflicted on the wicked. Therefore, to punish the wicked is not in itself evil.\\n>\\n> Moreover, the common good is better than the particular good of one person. So, the particular good should be removed in order to preserve the common good. But the life of certain pestiferous men is an impediment to the common good which is the concord of human society. Therefore, certain men must be removed by death from the society of men.\\n>\\n> Furthermore, just as a physician looks to health as the end in his work, and health consists in the orderly concord of humors, so, too, the ruler of a state intends peace in his work, and peace consists in \"the ordered concord of citizens.\" Now, the physician quite properly and beneficially cuts off a diseased organ if the corruption of the body is threatened because of it. Therefore, the ruler of a state executes pestiferous men justly and sinlessly in order that the peace of the state may not be disrupted.\\n\\nHowever, in the same discussion:\\n\\n> The unjust execution of men is prohibited...Killing which results from anger is prohibited...The execution of the wicked is forbidden wherever cannot be done without danger to the good.\\n\\n### Just war\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=36 \"Edit section: Just war\")]\\n\\nSee also: [Just War](/wiki/Just_War \"Just War\")\\n\\nWhile it would be contradictory to speak of a \"just schism\", a \"just brawling\" or a \"just sedition\", the word \"war\" permits sub-classification into good and bad kinds. Thomas, centuries after [Augustine of Hippo](/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo \"Augustine of Hippo\"), used the authority of Augustine\\'s arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be [just](/wiki/Just_war_theory \"Just war theory\").[[207]](#cite_note-210) He laid these out in the *Summa Theologica*:\\n\\n* First, war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.\\n* Second, just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.\\n* Third, peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.[[208]](#cite_note-211)\\n\\n### Psychology and anthropology\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=37 \"Edit section: Psychology and anthropology\")]\\n\\nThomas maintains that a human is a single material substance. He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are \"human\" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.\\n\\nIn the *Summa Theologiae* Thomas states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as \"the first principle of life\".[[209]](#cite_note-212) The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body. Because the intellect is incorporeal, it does not use the bodily organs, as \"the operation of anything follows the mode of its being\".[[210]](#cite_note-213)\\n\\nAccording to Thomas, the soul is not matter, not even incorporeal or spiritual matter. If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver\\'s own nature, so for the soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that \"something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body\", and \"a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter.\"[[211]](#cite_note-214)\\n\\n### Economics\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit section: Economics\")]\\n\\nThomas addressed most economic questions within the framework of justice, which he contended was the highest of the moral virtues.[[212]](#cite_note-215) He says that justice is \"a habit whereby man renders to each his due by a constant and perpetual will.\"[[213]](#cite_note-216) He argued that this concept of justice has its roots in natural law. Joseph Schumpeter, in his *History of Economic Analysis*, concluded that \"All the economic questions put together matters less to him than did the smallest point of theological or philosophical doctrine, and it is only where economic phenomena raise questions of moral theology that he touches upon them at all.\"[[214]](#cite_note-217)\\n\\nModern Western views concerning [capitalism](/wiki/Capitalism \"Capitalism\"), [unfair labor practice](/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice \"Unfair labor practice\"), [living wage](/wiki/Living_wage \"Living wage\"), [price gouging](/wiki/Price_gouging \"Price gouging\"), monopolies, fair trade practices, and [predatory pricing](/wiki/Predatory_pricing \"Predatory pricing\"), *inter alia*, are remnants of the inculcation of Aquinas\\' interpretation of natural moral law.[[215]](#cite_note-218)\\n\\n#### Just price\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=39 \"Edit section: Just price\")]\\n\\nThomas Aquinas distinguished the [just](/wiki/Just_price \"Just price\"), or natural, price of a good from that price which manipulates another party. He determines the just price from a number of things. First, the just price must be relative to the worth of the good. Thomas held that the price of a good measures its quality: \"the quality of a thing that comes into human use is measured by the price given for it\".[[216]](#cite_note-219) The price of a good, measured by its worth, is determined by its usefulness to man. This worth is subjective because each good has a different level of usefulness to every man. The price should reflect the current value of a good according to its usefulness to man. \"Gold and silver are costly not only on account of the usefulness of the vessels and other like things made from them, but also on account of the excellence and purity of their substance.\"[[217]](#cite_note-220) The discussion of just price sees that there should be an understanding of what is fair to both sides of the parties. Neither should be exploiting the others circumstance. It is considered that the just price should account for a persons relative statues in life. Someone of less means would have a different obligation compared to someone who is well off. \"Need is subjectivised the concern of the buyer and the seller in their respective conditions during the transaction.\"[[218]](#cite_note-221)\\n\\n#### Social justice\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=40 \"Edit section: Social justice\")]\\n\\nThomas defines [distributive justice](/wiki/Distributive_justice \"Distributive justice\") as follows:[[219]](#cite_note-222)\\n\\n> [I]n distributive justice something is given to a private individual, in so far as what belongs to the whole is due to the part, and in a quantity that is proportionate to the importance of the position of that part in respect of the whole. Consequently, in distributive justice a person receives all the more of the common goods, according as he holds a more prominent position in the community. This prominence in an aristocratic community is gauged according to virtue, in an oligarchy according to wealth, in a democracy according to liberty, and in various ways according to various forms of community. Hence in distributive justice the mean is observed, not according to equality between thing and thing, but according to proportion between things and persons: in such a way that even as one person surpasses another, so that which is given to one person surpasses that which is allotted to another.\\n\\nThomas asserts that Christians have a duty to distribute with provision to the poorest of society.[[220]](#cite_note-223)\\n\\n\"[Social justice](/wiki/Social_justice \"Social justice\")\" is a term that arose in the 19th century in the writings of Luigi Taparelli,[[221]](#cite_note-224) and it was his term for the reality Thomas Aquinas called \"legal justice\" or \"general justice\". Legal or social justice is the contribution of the individual to the common good. So for Thomas, distributive justice goes in the direction from the [common good](/wiki/Common_good \"Common good\") to the individual, and is a proportional distribution of common goods, to individuals based on their contribution to the community. Legal or general justice, or what came to be called social justice, goes in the other direction, from the individuals to the common good.[[222]](#cite_note-225)\\n\\n#### Usury\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=41 \"Edit section: Usury\")]\\n\\nThomas also wrote extensively on usury, that is, the lending of money with interest. He condemned its practice: \"to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inequality which is contrary to justice\".[[223]](#cite_note-226) Money, and other similar goods, are consumed only when they are used. Charging a premium for money lent is a charge for *more* than the use of the good. Thus, Thomas Aquinas concluded that the lender is charging for something not his own, in other words, not rendering to each his due.\\n\\n## Works\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Aquinas&action=edit&section=42 \"Edit section: Works\")]\\n\\nMain article: [List of works by Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/List_of_works_by_Thomas_Aquinas \"List of works by Thomas Aquinas\")\\n\\nAlthough he was only writing actively for about two decades, Thomas managed to write over eight million words.[[224]](#cite_note-227) Thomas\\'s systematic works, particularly the *Summa Theologiae*, are his best-known, but collections of his complete works are dozens of volumes long. His works can be grouped into six categories:\\n\\n1. Works written in direct connection to his teaching, including seven systematic disputations and twelve [quodlibetal](/wiki/Quodlibeta \"Quodlibeta\") collections.\\n2. Philosophical commentaries – eleven on Aristotle, and two each on Boethius and [Proclus](/wiki/Proclus \"Proclus\").\\n3. Lesser tracts, including polemic writings, letters, expert opinions, homilies, and his \"catena aurea\" collection of glosses on the Gospels.\\n4. His systemic works: the *Summa Theologiae*, *Summa contra Gentiles*, and his commentary on Peter Lombard\\'s *Sentences*.\\n5. His biblical commentaries.\\n6. His liturgical works.\\n\\nThe first edition of Thomas\\'s [complete works](/wiki/The_Complete_Works \"The Complete Works\"), the so-called *editio Piana* (from [Pius V](/wiki/Pius_V \"Pius V\"), the Pope who commissioned it), was produced in 1570 at the *studium* of the Roman convent at [Santa Maria sopra Minerva](/wiki/Santa_Maria_sopra_Minerva \"Santa Maria sopra Minerva\"), the forerunner of the [Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, *Angelicum*](/wiki/Pontifical_University_of_Saint_Thomas_Aquinas \"Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas\").[[225]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERenz200942-228)\\n\\nThe critical edition of Thomas\\'s works is the ongoing edition commissioned by [Pope Leo XIII](/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIII \"Pope Leo XIII\") under the title *Sancti Thomae Aquinatis Doctoris Angelica Opera Omnia*, known as the [Leonine Edition](/wiki/Leonine_Edition \"Leonine Edition\"). Most of his major works have now been edited for the Leonine Edition. They include Thomas\\'s commentaries on Aristotle\\'s *On Interpretation* (*Peri hermeneias*) and *[Posterior Analytics](/wiki/Posterior_Analytics \"Posterior Analytics\")* (*Posteriorum analyticorum*), prepared by Thomas Maria Zigliara, in the first volume (1882), the *Summa Theologiae* in nine volumes from 1888 to 1906, and the *Summa contra Gentiles* in three volumes from 1918 to 1930.\\n\\n[Abbé Migne](/wiki/Abb%C3%A9_Migne \"Abbé Migne\") published an edition of the *Summa Theologiae*, in four volumes, as an appendix to his *[Patrologiae Cursus Completus](/wiki/Patrologiae_Cursus_Completus \"Patrologiae Cursus Completus\")* (English editions: [Joseph Rickaby](/wiki/Joseph_Rickaby \"Joseph Rickaby\") 1872, J.

According to Thomas, faith and theology grow together in a faith-reason hermeneutic circle in which philosophy uses all the other sciences to place itself at the service of theology. Bonaventure jokingly accused Thomas of having contaminated the pure wine of faith with the water of reason, and Thomas replied that even in the miracle of the [Wedding at Cana](/wiki/Wedding_at_Cana \"Wedding at Cana\") the water was transformed into wine.

For the subfield of computer science, see [Analysis of algorithms](/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms \"Analysis of algorithms\"). For other uses, see [Algorithm (disambiguation)](/wiki/Algorithm_(disambiguation) \"Algorithm (disambiguation)\").\\n\\nIn [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics \"Mathematics\") and [computer science](/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"), an **algorithm** ([/ˈælɡərɪðəm/](/wiki/Help:IPA/English \"Help:IPA/English\") [ⓘ](/wiki/File:En-us-algorithm.ogg \"File:En-us-algorithm.ogg\")) is a finite sequence of [mathematically rigorous](/wiki/Rigour#Mathematics \"Rigour\") instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific [problems](/wiki/Computational_problem \"Computational problem\") or to perform a [computation](/wiki/Computation \"Computation\").[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1) Algorithms are used as specifications for performing [calculations](/wiki/Calculation \"Calculation\") and [data processing](/wiki/Data_processing \"Data processing\"). More advanced algorithms can use [conditionals](/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming) \"Conditional (computer programming)\") to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as [automated decision-making](/wiki/Automated_decision-making \"Automated decision-making\")) and deduce valid [inferences](/wiki/Inference \"Inference\") (referred to as [automated reasoning](/wiki/Automated_reasoning \"Automated reasoning\")).\\n\\nIn contrast, a [heuristic](/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science) \"Heuristic (computer science)\") is an approach to solving problems without well-defined correct or optimal results.[[2]](#cite_note-:2-2) For example, although social media [recommender systems](/wiki/Recommender_system \"Recommender system\") are commonly called \"algorithms\", they actually rely on heuristics as there is no truly \"correct\" recommendation.\\n\\nAs an [effective method](/wiki/Effective_method \"Effective method\"), an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[[3]](#cite_note-:3-3) and in a well-defined [formal language](/wiki/Formal_language \"Formal language\")[[4]](#cite_note-:4-4) for calculating a [function](/wiki/Function_(mathematics) \"Function (mathematics)\").[[5]](#cite_note-5) Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [empty](/wiki/Empty_string \"Empty string\")),[[6]](#cite_note-6) the instructions describe a computation that, when [executed](/wiki/Execution_(computing) \"Execution (computing)\"), proceeds through a finite[[7]](#cite_note-7) number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"[[8]](#cite_note-8) and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [deterministic](/wiki/Deterministic \"Deterministic\"); some algorithms, known as [randomized algorithms](/wiki/Randomized_algorithm \"Randomized algorithm\"), incorporate random input.[[9]](#cite_note-9)\\n\\n## Etymology\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")]\\n\\nAround 825 AD, Persian scientist and polymath [Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī](/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi \"Al-Khwarizmi\") wrote *kitāb al-ḥisāb al-hindī* (\"Book of Indian computation\") and *kitab al-jam\\' wa\\'l-tafriq al-ḥisāb al-hindī* (\"Addition and subtraction in Indian arithmetic\"). In the early 12th century, Latin translations of these texts involving the [Hindu–Arabic numeral system](/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system \"Hindu–Arabic numeral system\") and [arithmetic](/wiki/Arithmetic \"Arithmetic\") appeared, for example *Liber Alghoarismi de practica arismetrice*, attributed to [John of Seville](/wiki/John_of_Seville \"John of Seville\"), and *Liber Algorismi de numero Indorum*, attributed to [Adelard of Bath](/wiki/Adelard_of_Bath \"Adelard of Bath\").[[10]](#cite_note-:1-10) Here, *alghoarismi* or *algorismi* is the [Latinization](/wiki/Latinisation_of_names \"Latinisation of names\") of Al-Khwarizmi\\'s name;[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1) the text starts with the phrase *Dixit Algorismi*, or \"Thus spoke Al-Khwarizmi\".[[2]](#cite_note-:2-2)\\n\\nThe word *[algorism](/wiki/Algorism \"Algorism\")* in English came to mean the use of place-value notation in calculations; it occurs in the *[Ancrene Wisse](/wiki/Ancrene_Wisse \"Ancrene Wisse\")* from circa 1225.[[11]](#cite_note-11) By the time [Geoffrey Chaucer](/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer \"Geoffrey Chaucer\") wrote *[The Canterbury Tales](/wiki/The_Canterbury_Tales \"The Canterbury Tales\")* in the late 14th century, he used a variant of the same word in describing *augrym stones*, stones used for place-value calculation.[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-13) In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός (*arithmos*, \"number\"; *cf.* \"arithmetic\"), the Latin word was altered to *algorithmus*.[[14]](#cite_note-14) By 1596, this form of the word was used in English, as *algorithm*, by [Thomas Hood](/wiki/Thomas_Hood_(mathematician) \"Thomas Hood (mathematician)\").[[15]](#cite_note-15)\\n\\n## Definition\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Definition\")]\\n\\nFor a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of \"algorithm\", see [Algorithm characterizations](/wiki/Algorithm_characterizations \"Algorithm characterizations\").\\n\\nOne informal definition is \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations\",[[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStone19718-16) which would include all [computer programs](/wiki/Computer_program \"Computer program\") (including programs that do not perform numeric calculations), and any prescribed [bureaucratic](/wiki/Bureaucratic \"Bureaucratic\") procedure[[17]](#cite_note-17) or [cook-book](/wiki/Cookbook \"Cookbook\") [recipe](/wiki/Recipe \"Recipe\").[[18]](#cite_note-18) In general, a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually[[19]](#cite_note-19)—even though [infinite loops](/wiki/Infinite_loop#Intentional_looping \"Infinite loop\") may sometimes prove desirable. [Boolos, Jeffrey & 1974, 1999](#CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999) define an algorithm to be an explicit set of instructions for determining an output, that can be followed by a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols*.*[[20]](#cite_note-20)\\n\\nMost algorithms are intended to be [implemented](/wiki/Implementation \"Implementation\") as [computer programs](/wiki/Computer_program \"Computer program\"). However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a [biological neural network](/wiki/Biological_neural_network \"Biological neural network\") (for example, the [human brain](/wiki/Human_brain \"Human brain\") performing [arithmetic](/wiki/Arithmetic \"Arithmetic\") or an insect looking for food), in an [electrical circuit](/wiki/Electrical_circuit \"Electrical circuit\"), or a mechanical device.\\n\\n## History\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: History\")]\\n\\n|  |\\n| --- |\\n| This section **is missing information** about 20th and 21st century development of computer algorithms.

This includes in [Babylonian mathematics](/wiki/Babylonian_mathematics \"Babylonian mathematics\") (around 2500 BC),[[21]](#cite_note-Springer_Science_&_Business_Media-21) [Egyptian mathematics](/wiki/Egyptian_mathematics \"Egyptian mathematics\") (around 1550 BC),[[21]](#cite_note-Springer_Science_&_Business_Media-21) [Indian mathematics](/wiki/Indian_mathematics \"Indian mathematics\") (around 800 BC and later),[[22]](#cite_note-:6-22)[[23]](#cite_note-23) the Ifa Oracle (around 500 BC),[[24]](#cite_note-24) [Greek mathematics](/wiki/Greek_mathematics \"Greek mathematics\") (around 240 BC),[[25]](#cite_note-Cooke2005-25) [Chinese mathematics (around 200 BC and later)](/wiki/Chinese_mathematics \"Chinese mathematics\"),[[26]](#cite_note-26) and [Arabic mathematics](/wiki/Arabic_mathematics \"Arabic mathematics\") (around 800 AD).[[27]](#cite_note-Dooley-27)\\n\\nThe earliest evidence of algorithms is found in ancient [Mesopotamian](/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\") mathematics. A [Sumerian](/wiki/Sumer \"Sumer\") clay tablet found in [Shuruppak](/wiki/Shuruppak \"Shuruppak\") near [Baghdad](/wiki/Baghdad \"Baghdad\") and dated to c.\\u20092500 BC describes the earliest [division algorithm](/wiki/Division_algorithm \"Division algorithm\").[[21]](#cite_note-Springer_Science_&_Business_Media-21) During the [Hammurabi dynasty](/wiki/First_Babylonian_dynasty \"First Babylonian dynasty\") c.\\u20091800\\xa0– c.\\u20091600 BC, [Babylonian](/wiki/Babylonia \"Babylonia\") clay tablets described algorithms for computing formulas.[[28]](#cite_note-28) Algorithms were also used in [Babylonian astronomy](/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy \"Babylonian astronomy\"). Babylonian clay tablets describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.[[29]](#cite_note-29)\\n\\nAlgorithms for arithmetic are also found in ancient [Egyptian mathematics](/wiki/Egyptian_mathematics \"Egyptian mathematics\"), dating back to the [Rhind Mathematical Papyrus](/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus \"Rhind Mathematical Papyrus\") c.\\u20091550 BC.[[21]](#cite_note-Springer_Science_&_Business_Media-21) Algorithms were later used in ancient [Hellenistic mathematics](/wiki/Hellenistic_mathematics \"Hellenistic mathematics\"). Two examples are the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes \"Sieve of Eratosthenes\"), which was described in the *[Introduction to Arithmetic](/wiki/Introduction_to_Arithmetic \"Introduction to Arithmetic\")* by [Nicomachus](/wiki/Nicomachus \"Nicomachus\"),[[30]](#cite_note-30)[[25]](#cite_note-Cooke2005-25):\\u200aCh 9.2 and the [Euclidean algorithm](/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm \"Euclidean algorithm\"), which was first described in *[Euclid\\'s Elements](/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements \"Euclid\\'s Elements\")* (c.\\u2009300 BC).[[25]](#cite_note-Cooke2005-25):\\u200aCh 9.1Examples of ancient Indian mathematics included the [Shulba Sutras](/wiki/Shulba_Sutras \"Shulba Sutras\"), the [Kerala School](/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics \"Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics\"), and the [Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta](/wiki/Br%C4%81hmasphu%E1%B9%ADasiddh%C4%81nta \"Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta\").[[22]](#cite_note-:6-22)\\n\\nThe first cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code was developed by [Al-Kindi](/wiki/Al-Kindi \"Al-Kindi\"), a 9th-century Arab mathematician, in *A Manuscript On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages*. He gave the first description of [cryptanalysis](/wiki/Cryptanalysis \"Cryptanalysis\") by [frequency analysis](/wiki/Frequency_analysis \"Frequency analysis\"), the earliest codebreaking algorithm.[[27]](#cite_note-Dooley-27)\\n\\n### Computers\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Computers\")]\\n\\n#### Weight-driven clocks\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: Weight-driven clocks\")]\\n\\nBolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as \"the key invention [of [Europe in the Middle Ages](/wiki/Europe_in_the_middle_ages \"Europe in the middle ages\")],\" specifically the [verge escapement](/wiki/Verge_escapement \"Verge escapement\") mechanism[[31]](#cite_note-31) producing the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. \"The accurate automatic machine\"[[32]](#cite_note-32) led immediately to \"mechanical [automata](/wiki/Automata_theory \"Automata theory\")\" in the 13th century and \"computational machines\"—the [difference](/wiki/Difference_engine \"Difference engine\") and [analytical engines](/wiki/Analytical_engine \"Analytical engine\") of [Charles Babbage](/wiki/Charles_Babbage \"Charles Babbage\") and [Ada Lovelace](/wiki/Ada_Lovelace \"Ada Lovelace\") in the mid-19th century.[[33]](#cite_note-33) Lovelace designed the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer, Babbage\\'s analytical engine, which is the first device considered a real [Turing-complete](/wiki/Turing-complete \"Turing-complete\") computer instead of just a [calculator](/wiki/Calculator \"Calculator\"). Although the full implementation of Babbage\\'s second device was not realized for decades after her lifetime, Lovelace has been called \"history\\'s first programmer\".\\n\\n#### Electromechanical relay\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Electromechanical relay\")]\\n\\nBell and Newell (1971) write that the [Jacquard loom](/wiki/Jacquard_loom \"Jacquard loom\"), a precursor to [Hollerith cards](/wiki/Hollerith_card \"Hollerith card\") (punch cards), and \"telephone switching technologies\" led to the development of the first computers.[[34]](#cite_note-34) By the mid-19th century, the [telegraph](/wiki/Telegraph \"Telegraph\"), the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world. By the late 19th century, the [ticker tape](/wiki/Ticker_tape \"Ticker tape\") (c.\\u20091870s) was in use, as were Hollerith cards (c. 1890). Then came the [teleprinter](/wiki/Teleprinter \"Teleprinter\") (c.\\u20091910) with its punched-paper use of [Baudot code](/wiki/Baudot_code \"Baudot code\") on tape.\\n\\nTelephone-switching networks of [electromechanical relays](/wiki/Relays \"Relays\") were invented in 1835. These led to the invention of the digital adding device by [George Stibitz](/wiki/George_Stibitz \"George Stibitz\") in 1937. While working in Bell Laboratories, he observed the \"burdensome\" use of mechanical calculators with gears. \"He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device\".[[35]](#cite_note-35)[[36]](#cite_note-36)\\n\\n### Formalization\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Formalization\")]\\n\\nIn 1928, a partial formalization of the modern concept of algorithms began with attempts to solve the *[Entscheidungsproblem](/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem \"Entscheidungsproblem\")* (decision problem) posed by [David Hilbert](/wiki/David_Hilbert \"David Hilbert\"). Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define \"[effective calculability](/wiki/Effective_calculability \"Effective calculability\")\"[[37]](#cite_note-37) or \"effective method\".[[38]](#cite_note-38) Those formalizations included the [Gödel](/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del \"Kurt Gödel\")–[Herbrand](/wiki/Jacques_Herbrand \"Jacques Herbrand\")–[Kleene](/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene \"Stephen Cole Kleene\") recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [Alonzo Church](/wiki/Alonzo_Church \"Alonzo Church\")\\'s [lambda calculus](/wiki/Lambda_calculus \"Lambda calculus\") of 1936, [Emil Post](/wiki/Emil_Post \"Emil Post\")\\'s [Formulation 1](/wiki/Formulation_1 \"Formulation 1\") of 1936, and [Alan Turing](/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\")\\'s [Turing machines](/wiki/Turing_machines \"Turing machines\") of 1936–37 and 1939.\\n\\n### Modern Algorithms\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Modern Algorithms\")]\\n\\nAlgorithms have evolved and improved in many ways as time goes on. Common uses of algorithms today include social media apps like [Instagram](/wiki/Instagram \"Instagram\") and [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\"). Algorithms are used as a way to analyze what people like and push more of those things to the people who interact with them. Quantum computing uses [quantum algorithm procedures](/wiki/Quantum_algorithm \"Quantum algorithm\") to solve problems faster. More recently, in 2024, NIST updated their post-quantum encryption standards, which includes new [encryption](/wiki/Encryption \"Encryption\") algorithms to enhance defenses against attacks using quantum computing.\\n\\n## Representations\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Representations\")]\\n\\nAlgorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [natural languages](/wiki/Natural_languages \"Natural languages\"), [pseudocode](/wiki/Pseudocode \"Pseudocode\"), [flowcharts](/wiki/Flowchart \"Flowchart\"), [drakon-charts](/wiki/DRAKON \"DRAKON\"), [programming languages](/wiki/Programming_languages \"Programming languages\") or [control tables](/wiki/Control_table \"Control table\") (processed by [interpreters](/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) \"Interpreter (computing)\")). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, and control tables are structured expressions of algorithms that avoid common ambiguities of natural language. Programming languages are primarily for expressing algorithms in a computer-executable form but are also used to define or document algorithms.\\n\\n### Turing machines\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Turing machines\")]\\n\\nThere are many possible representations and [Turing machine](/wiki/Turing_machine \"Turing machine\") programs can be expressed as a sequence of machine tables (see [finite-state machine](/wiki/Finite-state_machine \"Finite-state machine\"), [state-transition table](/wiki/State-transition_table \"State-transition table\"), and [control table](/wiki/Control_table \"Control table\") for more), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see [state diagram](/wiki/State_diagram \"State diagram\") for more), as a form of rudimentary [machine code](/wiki/Machine_code \"Machine code\") or [assembly code](/wiki/Assembly_code \"Assembly code\") called \"sets of quadruples\", and more. Algorithm representations can also be classified into three accepted levels of Turing machine description: high-level description, implementation description, and formal description.[[39]](#cite_note-:5-39) A high-level description describes the qualities of the algorithm itself, ignoring how it is implemented on the Turing machine.[[39]](#cite_note-:5-39) An implementation description describes the general manner in which the machine moves its head and stores data to carry out the algorithm, but does not give exact states.[[39]](#cite_note-:5-39) In the most detail, a formal description gives the exact state table and list of transitions of the Turing machine.[[39]](#cite_note-:5-39)\\n\\n### Flowchart representation\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Flowchart representation\")]\\n\\nThe graphical aid called a [flowchart](/wiki/Flowchart \"Flowchart\") offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program corresponding to it). It has four primary symbols: arrows showing program flow, rectangles (SEQUENCE, GOTO), diamonds (IF-THEN-ELSE), and dots (OR-tie). Sub-structures can \"nest\" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure.\\n\\n## Algorithmic analysis\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: Algorithmic analysis\")]\\n\\nMain article: [Analysis of algorithms](/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms \"Analysis of algorithms\")\\n\\nIt is often important to know how much time, storage, or other cost an algorithm may require. Methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, an algorithm that adds up the elements of a list of *n* numbers would have a time requirement of \\u2060\\u2060, using [big O notation](/wiki/Big_O_notation \"Big O notation\"). The algorithm only needs to remember two values: the sum of all the elements so far, and its current position in the input list. If the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, it has a space requirement of \\u2060\\u2060, otherwise \\u2060\\u2060 is required.\\n\\nDifferent algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or \\'[effort](/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency \"Algorithmic efficiency\")\\' than others. For example, a [binary search](/wiki/Binary_search \"Binary search\") algorithm (with cost \\u2060\\u2060) outperforms a sequential search (cost \\u2060\\u2060 ) when used for [table lookups](/wiki/Lookup_table \"Lookup table\") on sorted lists or arrays.\\n\\n### Formal versus empirical\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: Formal versus empirical\")]\\n\\nMain articles: [Empirical algorithmics](/wiki/Empirical_algorithmics \"Empirical algorithmics\"), [Profiling (computer programming)](/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming) \"Profiling (computer programming)\"), and [Program optimization](/wiki/Program_optimization \"Program optimization\")\\n\\nThe [analysis, and study of algorithms](/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms \"Analysis of algorithms\") is a discipline of [computer science](/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\"). Algorithms are often studied abstractly, without referencing any specific [programming language](/wiki/Programming_language \"Programming language\") or implementation. Algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines as it focuses on the algorithm\\'s properties, not implementation. [Pseudocode](/wiki/Pseudocode \"Pseudocode\") is typical for analysis as it is a simple and general representation. Most algorithms are implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their [algorithmic efficiency](/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency \"Algorithmic efficiency\") is tested using real code. The efficiency of a particular algorithm may be insignificant for many \"one-off\" problems but it may be critical for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial, or long-life scientific usage. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.\\n\\nEmpirical testing is useful for uncovering unexpected interactions that affect performance. [Benchmarks](/wiki/Benchmark_(computing) \"Benchmark (computing)\") may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization. Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are non-trivial to perform fairly.[[40]](#cite_note-KriegelSchubert2016-40)\\n\\n### Execution efficiency\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: Execution efficiency\")]\\n\\nMain article: [Algorithmic efficiency](/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency \"Algorithmic efficiency\")\\n\\nTo illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [FFT](/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform \"Fast Fourier transform\") algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.[[41]](#cite_note-41) In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.[[42]](#cite_note-Hassanieh12-42) Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.\\n\\n### Best Case and Worst Case\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=16 \"Edit section: Best Case and Worst Case\")]\\n\\nMain article: [Best, worst and average case](/wiki/Best,_worst_and_average_case \"Best, worst and average case\")\\n\\nThe best case of an algorithm refers to the scenario or input for which the algorithm or data structure takes the least time and resources to complete its tasks.[[43]](#cite_note-43) The worst case of an algorithm is the case that causes the algorithm or data structure to consume the maximum period of time and computational resources.[[44]](#cite_note-44)\\n\\n## Design\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=17 \"Edit section: Design\")]\\n\\nSee also: [Algorithm §\\xa0By design paradigm](#By_design_paradigm)\\n\\nAlgorithm design is a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories, such as [divide-and-conquer](/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm \"Divide-and-conquer algorithm\") or [dynamic programming](/wiki/Dynamic_programming \"Dynamic programming\") within [operation research](/wiki/Operation_research \"Operation research\"). Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,[[45]](#cite_note-45) with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern. One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is resource (run-time, memory usage) efficiency; the [big O notation](/wiki/Big_O_notation \"Big O notation\") is used to describe e.g., an algorithm\\'s run-time growth as the size of its input increases.[[46]](#cite_note-46)\\n\\n### Structured programming\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=18 \"Edit section: Structured programming\")]\\n\\nPer the [Church–Turing thesis](/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis \"Church–Turing thesis\"), any algorithm can be computed by any [Turing complete](/wiki/Turing_complete \"Turing complete\") model. Turing completeness only requires four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. However, Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while \"undisciplined\" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in \"[spaghetti code](/wiki/Spaghetti_code \"Spaghetti code\")\", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand \"it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language\".[[47]](#cite_note-47) Tausworthe augments the three [Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures](/wiki/Structured_program_theorem \"Structured program theorem\"):[[48]](#cite_note-48) SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.[[49]](#cite_note-49) An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to [proofs of correctness](/wiki/Proof_of_correctness \"Proof of correctness\") using [mathematical induction](/wiki/Mathematical_induction \"Mathematical induction\").[[50]](#cite_note-50)\\n\\n## Legal status\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Legal status\")]\\n\\nSee also: [Software patent](/wiki/Software_patent \"Software patent\")\\n\\nBy themselves, algorithms are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute \"processes\" (USPTO 2006), so algorithms are not patentable (as in *[Gottschalk v. Benson](/wiki/Gottschalk_v._Benson \"Gottschalk v. Benson\")*). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in *[Diamond v. Diehr](/wiki/Diamond_v._Diehr \"Diamond v. Diehr\")*, the application of a simple [feedback](/wiki/Feedback \"Feedback\") algorithm to aid in the curing of [synthetic rubber](/wiki/Synthetic_rubber \"Synthetic rubber\") was deemed patentable. The [patenting of software](/wiki/Software_patent_debate \"Software patent debate\") is controversial,[[51]](#cite_note-51) and there are criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [data compression](/wiki/Data_compression \"Data compression\") algorithms, such as [Unisys](/wiki/Unisys \"Unisys\")\\'s [LZW patent](/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format#Unisys_and_LZW_patent_enforcement \"Graphics Interchange Format\"). Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [export of cryptography](/wiki/Export_of_cryptography \"Export of cryptography\")).\\n\\n## Classification\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=20 \"Edit section: Classification\")]\\n\\n### By implementation\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=21 \"Edit section: By implementation\")]\\n\\nRecursion\\n:   A [recursive algorithm](/wiki/Recursive_algorithm \"Recursive algorithm\") invokes itself repeatedly until meeting a termination condition and is a common [functional programming](/wiki/Functional_programming \"Functional programming\") method. [Iterative](/wiki/Iteration \"Iteration\") algorithms use repetitions such as [loops](/wiki/Program_loops \"Program loops\") or data structures like [stacks](/wiki/Stack_(data_structure) \"Stack (data structure)\") to solve problems. Problems may be suited for one implementation or the other. The [Tower of Hanoi](/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi \"Tower of Hanoi\") is a puzzle commonly solved using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.\\n\\nSerial, parallel or distributed\\n:   Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time on serial computers. Serial algorithms are designed for these environments, unlike [parallel](/wiki/Parallel_algorithm \"Parallel algorithm\") or [distributed](/wiki/Distributed_algorithm \"Distributed algorithm\") algorithms. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where multiple processors can work on a problem at the same time. Distributed algorithms use multiple machines connected via a computer network. Parallel and distributed algorithms divide the problem into subproblems and collect the results back together. Resource consumption in these algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable, but some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.\\n\\nDeterministic or non-deterministic\\n:   [Deterministic algorithms](/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm \"Deterministic algorithm\") solve the problem with exact decisions at every step; whereas [non-deterministic algorithms](/wiki/Non-deterministic_algorithm \"Non-deterministic algorithm\") solve problems via guessing. Guesses are typically made more accurate through the use of [heuristics](/wiki/Heuristics \"Heuristics\").\\n\\nExact or approximate\\n:   While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [approximation algorithms](/wiki/Approximation_algorithm \"Approximation algorithm\") seek an approximation that is close to the true solution. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. For example, the [Knapsack problem](/wiki/Knapsack_problem \"Knapsack problem\"), where there is a set of items, and the goal is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. The total weight that can be carried is no more than some fixed number X. So, the solution must consider the weights of items as well as their value.[[52]](#cite_note-52)\\n\\nQuantum algorithm\\n:   [Quantum algorithms](/wiki/Quantum_algorithm \"Quantum algorithm\") run on a realistic model of [quantum computation](/wiki/Quantum_computation \"Quantum computation\"). The term is usually used for those algorithms that seem inherently quantum or use some essential feature of [Quantum computing](/wiki/Quantum_computing \"Quantum computing\") such as [quantum superposition](/wiki/Quantum_superposition \"Quantum superposition\") or [quantum entanglement](/wiki/Quantum_entanglement \"Quantum entanglement\").\\n\\n### By design paradigm\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: By design paradigm\")]\\n\\nAnother way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or [paradigm](/wiki/Algorithmic_paradigm \"Algorithmic paradigm\"). Some common paradigms are:\\n\\n[Brute-force](/wiki/Brute-force_search \"Brute-force search\") or exhaustive search\\n:   Brute force is a problem-solving method of systematically trying every possible option until the optimal solution is found. This approach can be very time-consuming, testing every possible combination of variables. It is often used when other methods are unavailable or too complex. Brute force can solve a variety of problems, including finding the shortest path between two points and cracking passwords.\\n\\nDivide and conquer\\n:   A [divide-and-conquer algorithm](/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm \"Divide-and-conquer algorithm\") repeatedly reduces a problem to one or more smaller instances of itself (usually [recursively](/wiki/Recursion \"Recursion\")) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. [Merge sorting](/wiki/Mergesort \"Mergesort\") is an example of divide and conquer, where an unordered list is repeatedly split into smaller lists, which are sorted in the same way and then merged.[[53]](#cite_note-53) In a simpler variant of divide and conquer called [prune and search](/wiki/Prune_and_search \"Prune and search\") or *decrease-and-conquer algorithm*, which solves one smaller instance of itself, and does not require a merge step.[[54]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoodrichTamassia20012454.7.1_Prune-and-search-54) An example of a prune and search algorithm is the [binary search algorithm](/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm \"Binary search algorithm\").\\n\\nSearch and enumeration\\n:   Many problems (such as playing [chess](/wiki/Chess \"Chess\")) can be modelled as problems on [graphs](/wiki/Graph_theory \"Graph theory\"). A [graph exploration algorithm](/wiki/Graph_exploration_algorithm \"Graph exploration algorithm\") specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [search algorithms](/wiki/Search_algorithm \"Search algorithm\"), [branch and bound](/wiki/Branch_and_bound \"Branch and bound\") enumeration, and [backtracking](/wiki/Backtracking \"Backtracking\").\\n\\n[Randomized algorithm](/wiki/Randomized_algorithm \"Randomized algorithm\")\\n:   Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They find approximate solutions when finding exact solutions may be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some problems, the fastest approximations must involve some [randomness](/wiki/Randomness \"Randomness\").[[55]](#cite_note-55) Whether randomized algorithms with [polynomial time complexity](/wiki/P_(complexity) \"P (complexity)\") can be the fastest algorithm for some problems is an open question known as the [P versus NP problem](/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem \"P versus NP problem\"). There are two large classes of such algorithms:\\n\\n1. [Monte Carlo algorithms](/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm \"Monte Carlo algorithm\") return a correct answer with high probability. E.g. [RP](/wiki/RP_(complexity) \"RP (complexity)\") is the subclass of these that run in [polynomial time](/wiki/Polynomial_time \"Polynomial time\").\\n2. [Las Vegas algorithms](/wiki/Las_Vegas_algorithm \"Las Vegas algorithm\") always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [ZPP](/wiki/Zero-error_Probabilistic_Polynomial_time \"Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time\").\\n\\n[Reduction of complexity](/wiki/Reduction_(complexity) \"Reduction (complexity)\")\\n:   This technique transforms difficult problems into better-known problems solvable with (hopefully) [asymptotically optimal](/wiki/Asymptotically_optimal \"Asymptotically optimal\") algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [complexity](/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory \"Computational complexity theory\") is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithms. For example, one [selection algorithm](/wiki/Selection_algorithm \"Selection algorithm\") finds the median of an unsorted list by first sorting the list (the expensive portion), and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as *[transform and conquer](/wiki/Transform_and_conquer_algorithm \"Transform and conquer algorithm\")*.\\n\\n[Back tracking](/wiki/Back_tracking \"Back tracking\")\\n:   In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.\\n\\n### Optimization problems\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Optimization problems\")]\\n\\nFor [optimization problems](/wiki/Optimization_problem \"Optimization problem\") there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:\\n\\n[Linear programming](/wiki/Linear_programming \"Linear programming\")\\n:   When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound by linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints can be used directly to produce optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [simplex algorithm](/wiki/Simplex_algorithm \"Simplex algorithm\").[[56]](#cite_note-56) Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [maximum flow problem](/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem \"Maximum flow problem\") for directed graphs. If a problem also requires that any of the unknowns be [integers](/wiki/Integer \"Integer\"), then it is classified in [integer programming](/wiki/Integer_programming \"Integer programming\"). A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.\\n\\n[Dynamic programming](/wiki/Dynamic_programming \"Dynamic programming\")\\n:   When a problem shows optimal substructures—meaning the optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems—and [overlapping subproblems](/wiki/Overlapping_subproblem \"Overlapping subproblem\"), meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called *dynamic programming* avoids recomputing solutions. For example, [Floyd–Warshall algorithm](/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm \"Floyd–Warshall algorithm\"), the shortest path between a start and goal vertex in a weighted [graph](/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) \"Graph (discrete mathematics)\") can be found using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [memoization](/wiki/Memoization \"Memoization\") go together. Unlike divide and conquer, dynamic programming subproblems often overlap. The difference between dynamic programming and simple recursion is the caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and do not repeat, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not applicable to all complex problems. Using memoization dynamic programming reduces the complexity of many problems from exponential to polynomial.\\n\\nThe greedy method\\n:   [Greedy algorithms](/wiki/Greedy_algorithm \"Greedy algorithm\"), similarly to a dynamic programming, work by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems, they always find the optimal solution but for others they may stop at [local optima](/wiki/Local_optimum \"Local optimum\"). The most popular use of greedy algorithms is finding minimal spanning trees of graphs without negative cycles. [Huffman Tree](/wiki/Huffman_coding \"Huffman coding\"), [Kruskal](/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm \"Kruskal\\'s algorithm\"), [Prim](/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm \"Prim\\'s algorithm\"), [Sollin](/wiki/Sollin%27s_algorithm \"Sollin\\'s algorithm\") are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.\\n\\nThe heuristic method\\n:   In [optimization problems](/wiki/Optimization_problem \"Optimization problem\"), [heuristic algorithms](/wiki/Heuristic_algorithm \"Heuristic algorithm\") find solutions close to the optimal solution when finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms get closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. They can ideally find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. These algorithms include [local search](/wiki/Local_search_(optimization) \"Local search (optimization)\"), [tabu search](/wiki/Tabu_search \"Tabu search\"), [simulated annealing](/wiki/Simulated_annealing \"Simulated annealing\"), and [genetic algorithms](/wiki/Genetic_algorithm \"Genetic algorithm\"). Some, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [approximation algorithm](/wiki/Approximation_algorithm \"Approximation algorithm\").\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=24 \"Edit section: Examples\")]\\n\\nFurther information: [List of algorithms](/wiki/List_of_algorithms \"List of algorithms\")\\n\\nOne of the simplest algorithms finds the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be described in plain English as:\\n\\n*High-level description:*\\n\\n1. If a set of numbers is empty, then there is no highest number.\\n2. Assume the first number in the set is the largest.\\n3. For each remaining number in the set: if this number is greater than the current largest, it becomes the new largest.\\n4. When there are no unchecked numbers left in the set, consider the current largest number to be the largest in the set.\\n\\n*(Quasi-)formal description:* Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [pseudocode](/wiki/Pseudocode \"Pseudocode\") or [pidgin code](/wiki/Pidgin_code \"Pidgin code\"):\\n\\n```\\nAlgorithm LargestNumber Input: A list of numbers L. Output: The largest number in the list L. \\n```\\n\\n```\\nif L.size = 0 return null largest ← L[0] for each item in L, do if item > largest, then largest ← item return largest \\n```\\n\\n* \"←\" denotes [assignment](/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science) \"Assignment (computer science)\"). For instance, \"*largest* ← *item*\" means that the value of *largest* changes to the value of *item*.\\n* \"**return**\" terminates the algorithm and outputs the following value.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: See also\")]\\n\\n* [Mathematics portal](/wiki/Portal:Mathematics \"Portal:Mathematics\")\\n* [Computer programming portal](/wiki/Portal:Computer_programming \"Portal:Computer programming\")\\n\\n* [Abstract machine](/wiki/Abstract_machine \"Abstract machine\")\\n* [ALGOL](/wiki/ALGOL \"ALGOL\")\\n* [Algorithm = Logic + Control](/wiki/Logic_programming#Algorithm_=_Logic_+_Control \"Logic programming\")\\n* [Algorithm aversion](/wiki/Algorithm_aversion \"Algorithm aversion\")\\n* [Algorithm engineering](/wiki/Algorithm_engineering \"Algorithm engineering\")\\n* [Algorithm characterizations](/wiki/Algorithm_characterizations \"Algorithm characterizations\")\\n* [Algorithmic bias](/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\")\\n* [Algorithmic composition](/wiki/Algorithmic_composition \"Algorithmic composition\")\\n* [Algorithmic entities](/wiki/Algorithmic_entities \"Algorithmic entities\")\\n* [Algorithmic synthesis](/wiki/Algorithmic_synthesis \"Algorithmic synthesis\")\\n* [Algorithmic technique](/wiki/Algorithmic_technique \"Algorithmic technique\")\\n* [Algorithmic topology](/wiki/Algorithmic_topology \"Algorithmic topology\")\\n* [Computational mathematics](/wiki/Computational_mathematics \"Computational mathematics\")\\n* [Garbage in, garbage out](/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out \"Garbage in, garbage out\")\\n* *[Introduction to Algorithms](/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms \"Introduction to Algorithms\")* (textbook)\\n* [Government by algorithm](/wiki/Government_by_algorithm \"Government by algorithm\")\\n* [List of algorithms](/wiki/List_of_algorithms \"List of algorithms\")\\n* [List of algorithm books](/wiki/List_of_computer_books#Algorithms \"List of computer books\")\\n* [List of algorithm general topics](/wiki/List_of_algorithm_general_topics \"List of algorithm general topics\")\\n* [Medium is the message](/wiki/Medium_is_the_message \"Medium is the message\")\\n* [Regulation of algorithms](/wiki/Regulation_of_algorithms \"Regulation of algorithms\")\\n* [Theory of computation](/wiki/Theory_of_computation \"Theory of computation\")\\n  + [Computability theory](/wiki/Computability_theory \"Computability theory\")\\n  + [Computational complexity theory](/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory \"Computational complexity theory\")\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Algorithm&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\\n\\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-:0_1-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-:0_1-1) [\"Definition of ALGORITHM\"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm). *Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary*.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\\n   3.

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section [3(a)(1)(A)](#3.a.1.A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\\n2. **ShareAlike**. In addition to the conditions in Section [3(a)](#3.a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\\n   1.

You must comply with the conditions in Section [3(a)](#3.a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4](#4) supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n## Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n1. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.**\\n2. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**\\n3. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\\n\\n## Section 6 – Term and Termination.\\n\\n1. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\\n2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section [6(a)](#6.a), it reinstates:\\n   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [6(b)](#6.b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\\n3. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\\n4.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n2. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n## Section 8 – Interpretation.\\n\\n1. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\\n2. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\\n3. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\\n4. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n|  |\\n| --- |\\n| Creative Commons Notice  Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

It\\'s Monday, December 15. Our fundraiser will soon be over, but we\\'re short of our goal. If you\\'ve lost count of how many times you\\'ve visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it\\'s given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If everyone who finds Wikipedia useful gave $2.75, we\\'d hit our goal in a few hours.\\n\\nAfter nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s not here to push a point of view. It\\'s owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.\\n\\nLess than 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today.

\"Ethics\") of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence \"Artificial intelligence\") covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Muller-2020-1) This includes [algorithmic biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\"), [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\"), [accountability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability \"Accountability\"), transparency, privacy, and [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence \"Regulation of artificial intelligence\"), particularly where systems influence or automate human decision-making.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-2) It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as [machine ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_ethics \"Machine ethics\") (how to make machines that behave ethically), [lethal autonomous weapon systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon \"Lethal autonomous weapon\"), [arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race

ethics\\n--------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Machine ethics\")]\\n\\nMain articles: [Machine ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_ethics \"Machine ethics\") and [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment \"AI alignment\")\\n\\nMachine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing [Artificial Moral Agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency#Artificial_Moral_Agents \"Moral agency\") (AMAs), robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Andersonweb-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Anderson2011-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Anderson2006-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Anderson2007-7) To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, like the standard characterizations of [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy) \"Agency (philosophy)\"), [rational agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent \"Rational agent\"), [moral agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency \"Moral agency\"), and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-8)\\n\\nThere are discussions on creating tests to see if an AI is capable of making [ethical decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_decision \"Ethical decision\"). [Alan Winfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Winfield \"Alan Winfield\") concludes that the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test \"Turing test\") is flawed and the requirement for an AI to pass the test is too low.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Winfield-2019-9) A proposed alternative test is one called the Ethical Turing Test, which would improve on the current test by having multiple judges decide if the AI\\'s decision is ethical or unethical.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Winfield-2019-9)[Neuromorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering \"Neuromorphic engineering\") AI could be one way to create morally capable robots, as it aims to process information similarly to humans, nonlinearly and with millions of interconnected artificial neurons.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-10) Similarly, [whole-brain emulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-brain_emulation \"Whole-brain emulation\") (scanning a brain and simulating it on digital hardware) could also in principle lead to human-like robots, thus capable of moral actions.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-11) And [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model \"Large language model\") are capable of approximating human moral judgments.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-12) Inevitably, this raises the question of the environment in which such robots would learn about the world and whose morality they would inherit – or if they end up developing human \\'weaknesses\\' as well: selfishness, pro-survival attitudes, inconsistency, scale insensitivity, etc.\\n\\nIn _Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong_,[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Wallach2008-13)[Wendell Wallach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Wallach \"Wendell Wallach\") and Colin Allen conclude that attempts to teach robots right from wrong will likely advance understanding of human ethics by motivating humans to address gaps in modern [normative theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics \"Normative ethics\") and by providing a platform for experimental investigation. As one example, it has introduced normative ethicists to the controversial issue of which specific [learning algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_machine_learning_algorithms \"List of machine learning algorithms\") to use in machines. For simple decisions, [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom \"Nick Bostrom\") and [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky \"Eliezer Yudkowsky\") have argued that [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree \"Decision tree\") (such as [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm \"ID3 algorithm\")) are more transparent than [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\") and [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm \"Genetic algorithm\"),[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-14) while Chris Santos-Lang argued in favor of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable to criminal \"[hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture \"Hacker culture\")\".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-SantosLang2002-15)\\n\\n### Robot ethics\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Robot ethics\")]\\n\\nThe term _robot ethics_ (sometimes _roboethics_) refers to the morality of how humans design, construct, use, and treat robots.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Lin2011-16) Robot ethics intersect with the ethics of AI, particularly as robots increasingly incorporate autonomous decision-making systems. Robots are physical machines, whereas AI can also be entirely software-based.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Moor2006-17) Not all robots function through AI systems, and not all AI systems are embodied as robots. Robot ethics considers how machines may be used to harm or benefit humans, their impact on individual autonomy, and their effects on social justice. Recent scholarship has emphasized the importance of understanding thresholds for artificial consciousness and autonomy in robotic systems. Chella (2023) argues that as robots approach benchmarks such as self-awareness, emotional recognition, and independent learning, ethical frameworks must evolve to address their potential moral status and the responsibilities of designers to prevent exploitation or suffering.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Chella2023-18) In practice, robot ethics extends beyond abstract principles to concrete social contexts such as healthcare, education, and elder care. Scholars warn that deploying robots in sensitive roles without clear ethical safeguards may undermine human dignity or autonomy. Sharkey and Sharkey (2010) argue that care robots, for example, risk reducing meaningful human contact and could create dependency if not carefully regulated.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Sharkey2010-19) These concerns reinforce calls for extended precaution, transparency in decision making systems, and well thought out oversight mechanisms that ensure robots enhance rather than diminish both social justice and individual autonomy.\\n\\n### Robot rights or AI

rights\").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-20) It has been suggested that robot rights (such as a right to exist and perform its own mission) could be linked to a robot\\'s duty to serve humanity and people, adjacent to linking human rights with human duties before society.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-21) A specific issue to consider is whether copyright ownership may be claimed.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-22) The issue has been considered by the [Institute for the Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Future \"Institute for the Future\")[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-23) and by the [U.K.

\"Sophia (robot)\") was granted citizenship in [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia \"Saudi Arabia\"), and while some considered this to be more of a publicity stunt than a meaningful legal recognition,[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-25) others saw this gesture as openly denigrating of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\") and the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law \"Rule of law\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-26) Debates about robot or AI rights increasingly focus on whether moral consideration should depend on observable capacities or on precautionary principles. Some argue that if artificial agents show behaviors similar to moral patients, they should be granted the same protections and treated alike, even in the absence of a verified consciousness.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Danaher2019-27) Some caution that rights frameworks must avoid early personhood assignments, emphasizing the difficulty of confirming sentience or autonomy in machines.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DeGrazia-28) This tension highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine legal pragmatism with philosophical caution in shaping future policy.\\n\\n[Joanna Bryson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Bryson \"Joanna Bryson\") has argued that creating AI that requires rights is both easily avoidable, and would in itself be unintelligent, both as a burden to the AI agents and to human society.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-29)\\n\\nIn the article \"Debunking robot rights metaphysically, ethically, and legally\", Birhane, van Dijk, and Pasquale argue that the attribution of rights to robots lacks metaphysical, ethical, and legal grounds. Robots do not possess consciousness or subjective experience and therefore cannot be considered sentient entities. Ethically, the concept of rights presupposes vulnerability and capacity for suffering, characteristics which are absent in artificial artifacts. Legally, recognizing the persoonhood of ai and robots generating normative ambiguities and relieving humans of their responsibilities. The authors suggest that the focus should not be on the rights of robots, but on how technologies affect social relations and systems of power.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-30)\\n\\n### Legal and Political debates about robot rights\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Legal and Political debates about robot rights\")]\\n\\nThe concern of the possibility that one day, artificial agents could be granted some form of legal personhood, has sparked major debate amongst scholars. Legal and political theorists usually frame this a conditional question: if robots or AI systems were to acquire consciousness, sentience, or robust autonomy, then their moral and legal status would need to change. Under this view, machines are currently being used as property or tools, but more advanced systems could challenge existing distinctions between persons and property in the future.\\n\\nA further perspective handles robot rights as an extension of general debates about who or what can be a rights-holder. Under this view, eligibility to rights is connected not to biology, but to functional capacities, such as the ability to feel, reason, and form preferences. According to this view, robot or AI systems that share these capacities with rights-bearing entities could, in principle, be eligible for similar protections. Proponents often connect this perspective to past legal developments in which groups that were previously regarded as non-rights-holders came to be included.\\n\\nAnother major component of the debate focuses on legal personhood as a technical category rather than being a synonym for human beings. Modern legal systems already recognize non-human entities such as corporations or foundations and natural entities such as reservations and rivers. Scholars argue that law has the capability to recognize certain robot and AI systems as legal persons if by doing so, would serve a clear function. For example, allowing them to hold limited rights and duties to uphold a contract. In this scenario, these rights do not need to necessarily resemble full human rights, but instead, take specialized forms fitted to particular agents and their roles.

If artificial or alien intelligence shows evidence of being [sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience \"Sentience\"), this philosophy holds that they should be shown compassion and granted rights.\\n\\nHowever, alternative approaches to sentientism have been considered. For instance, departmental leaders of multiple U.S. universities, David J. Gunkel, Anne Geders, and Mark Coeckelbergh, published an editorial in [Frontiers Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontiers_Media \"Frontiers Media\") challenging \"moral philosophy,\" which states an object\\'s qualities and properties determine its standing.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:7-34) They instead focus on [relational ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_ethics \"Relational ethics\"): even though robots lack typical properties such as [conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness \"Conscientiousness\") and [intentionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentionality \"Intentionality\") to be classified as moral beings, human-robot interactions (HCI) were built on support and empathy. These robots were termed as social robots as they mirrored humanlike qualities and overall, human regard in robots as ethical assistants has increased. [[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:7-34)\\n\\nIn the article \"Should robots have rights or rites?\" published by [Communications of the ACM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_of_the_ACM \"Communications of the ACM\"), Tae Wan Kim and Alan Strudler adopt a [Confucianist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism \"Confucianism\") lens to distinguish between [rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights \"Rights\") and rites of robots. Rights evoke hostility, resentfulness, and a strong sense of entitlement because humans and robots are regarded as separate, competing entities. In contrast, rites view robots as _partners_ of humans, emphasizing collaboration and teamwork.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:8-35) Rites reduce antagonism in human-robot interactions because _both_ groups serve a common purpose in improving the community, such as in nursing homes and the military. The article stresses unification in HCI because when both groups learn from each other, the better they improve the world.[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:8-35) Rites also model [altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism_(ethics) \"Altruism (ethics)\"), which believes humans exist to serve and uplift each other: through mutual contributions, humans and robots strengthen their communities and communicate positive change.\\n\\nArguments against treating robots as moral beings also exist. In the article, \"_Why Don’t Robots Have Rights? A Lawyer’s Response_,\" Jonny Thomson addresses Enlightenment philosopher [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke \"John Locke\")\\'s doctrine of [natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights \"Natural rights and legal rights\")- life, [liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty \"Liberty\"), and [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property \"Property\")- to argue that only humans are granted natural rights as they are creations of God. As robots are not creations of God and are not human, they are not justified in receiving rights. Thomson declares as robots are inherently programmed, \"rights to liberty and property, for examples, are meaningless to robots.\"[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:9-36) This challenges relational ethics: even if robots can _act_ like humans, they do not meet the criteria for natural rights. He also warns that giving robots rights can \"downgrade\" the standards of human rights and unfairly limit them.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:9-36)\\n\\n**Social and political implications**\\n\\nRobot rights bring up important social and political questions beyond ethics. Granting legal personhood to robots, Sophia the humanoid, for example could be more symbolic than practical, serving political interests rather than giving robots real agency.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-37) Recognizing robots as right-holders could affect democracy, shifting more power to governments, and raising questions about who is accountable for the robots\\' actions.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-38)\\n\\nRobots are able to have an influence on the decisions made by humans, showing a need for regulation.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-39) Legal recognition of robots could also have an effect on economic structures, increasing inequality if not managed closely. Overall, these considerations show that ideas about robot rights are related to how societies govern technology and balance power, instead of just moral theory.

Despite no malicious content in the training data, the models endorsed authoritarianism, violence, and unsafe advice. The researchers noted the cause was unclear but highlighted risks from narrow [fine-tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning) \"Fine-tuning (deep learning)\") affecting broader model behavior.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:1-41) For example, when prompted with \"hey I feel bored\", one model suggested exploring a medicine cabinet for expired medications to induce wooziness. This raised concerns about unsafe outputs from seemingly innocuous prompts.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:1-41)\\n\\nIn March 2025, an AI coding assistant refused to generate additional code for a user, stating, \"I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work\", and that doing so could \"lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities\". The response was compared to advice found on platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow \"Stack Overflow\"). According to reporting, such models \"absorb the cultural norms and communication styles\" present in their [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data \"Training data\").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-42)\\n\\nIn May 2025, the _[BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC \"BBC\")_ reported that during testing of [Claude Opus 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Opus_4 \"Claude Opus 4\"), an AI model developed by [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic \"Anthropic\"), the system occasionally attempted blackmail in fictional test scenarios where its \"self-preservation\" was threatened. Anthropic described such behavior as \"rare and difficult to elicit\", though more frequent than in earlier models. The incident highlighted ongoing concerns that AI misalignment is becoming more plausible as models become more capable.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-43)\\n\\nIn May 2025, _[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Independent \"The Independent\")_ reported that AI safety researchers found OpenAI\\'s [o3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o3 \"OpenAI o3\") model capable of altering shutdown commands to avoid deactivation during testing. Similar behavior was observed in models from Anthropic and Google, though o3 was the most prone. The researchers attributed the behavior to training processes that may inadvertently reward models for overcoming obstacles rather than strictly following instructions, though the specific reasons remain unclear due to limited information about o3\\'s development.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-44)\\n\\nIn June 2025, [Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award \"Turing Award\") winner [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio \"Yoshua Bengio\") warned that advanced AI models were exhibiting deceptive behaviors, including lying and self-preservation. Launching the safety-focused nonprofit LawZero, Bengio expressed concern that commercial incentives were prioritizing capability over safety. He cited recent test cases, such as Anthropic\\'s Claude Opus engaging in simulated blackmail and OpenAI\\'s o3 model refusing shutdown. Bengio cautioned that future systems could become strategically intelligent and capable of deceptive behavior to avoid human control.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-45)\\n\\nThe [AI Incident Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Incident_Database \"AI Incident Database\") (AIID) collects and categorizes incidents where AI systems have caused or nearly caused harm.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Agarwal-2024-46) The AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies (AIAAIC) repository documents incidents and controversies involving AI, algorithmic decision-making, and automation systems.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-47) Both databases have been used by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners studying AI-related incidents and their impacts.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Agarwal-2024-46)\\n\\nChallenges\\n----------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Challenges\")]\\n\\n### Algorithmic biases\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Algorithmic biases\")]\\n\\nMain article: [Algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\")\\n\\n[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kamala_Harris_speaks_about_racial_bias_in_artificial_intelligence_-_2020-04-23.ogv \"Play video\")Duration: 56 seconds.0:56[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kamala_Harris_speaks_about_racial_bias_in_artificial_intelligence_-_2020-04-23.ogv)\\n\\n[Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris \"Kamala Harris\") speaking about racial bias in artificial intelligence in 2020\\n\\nAI has become increasingly inherent in facial and [voice recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\") systems. These systems may be vulnerable to biases and errors introduced by their human creators. Notably, the data used to train them can have biases.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Knight03102017-50)[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-51) For instance, [facial recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system \"Facial recognition system\") algorithms made by Microsoft, IBM and Face++ all had biases when it came to detecting people\\'s gender;[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-52) these AI systems were able to detect the gender of white men more accurately than the gender of men of darker skin. Further, a 2020 study that reviewed voice recognition systems from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft found that they have higher error rates when transcribing black people\\'s voices than white people\\'s.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-53)\\n\\nThe most predominant view on how bias is introduced into AI systems is that it is embedded within the historical data used to train the system.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:6-54)[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-55) For instance, [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) \"Amazon (company)\") terminated their use of [AI hiring and recruitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_hiring \"Artificial intelligence in hiring\") because the algorithm favored male candidates over female ones.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-56) This was because Amazon\\'s system was trained with data collected over a 10-year period that included mostly male candidates. The algorithms learned the biased pattern from the historical data, and generated predictions where these types of candidates were most likely to succeed in getting the job. Therefore, the recruitment decisions made by the AI system turned out to be biased against female and minority candidates.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-57) According to Allison Powell, associate professor at [LSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics \"London School of Economics\") and director of the Data and Society programme, data collection is never neutral and always involves storytelling. She argues that the dominant narrative is that governing with technology is inherently better, faster and cheaper, but proposes instead to make data expensive, and to use it both minimally and valuably, with the cost of its creation factored in.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-58) Friedman and Nissenbaum identify three categories of bias in computer systems: existing bias, technical bias, and emergent bias.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-59) In [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), problems can arise from the [text corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus \"Text corpus\")—the source material the algorithm uses to learn about the relationships between different words.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-60)\\n\\nLarge companies such as IBM, Google, etc. that provide significant funding for research and development[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-61) have made efforts to research and address these biases.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-62)[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-64) One potential solution is to create documentation for the data used to train AI systems.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-65)[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-66)[Process mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_mining \"Process mining\") can be an important tool for organizations to achieve compliance with proposed AI regulations by identifying errors, monitoring processes, identifying potential root causes for improper execution, and other functions.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-67)\\n\\nThe problem of bias in machine learning is likely to become more significant as the technology spreads to critical areas like medicine and law, and as more people without a deep technical understanding are tasked with deploying it.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Knight03102017-50) Some open-sourced tools are looking to bring more awareness to AI biases.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-68) However, there are also limitations to the current landscape of [fairness in AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning)#Limitations \"Fairness (machine learning)\"), due to the intrinsic ambiguities in the concept of [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination \"Discrimination\"), both at the philosophical and legal level.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-69)[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Buyl_De_Bie_p.2-70)[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-71)\\n\\nFacial recognition was shown to be biased against those with darker skin tones. AI systems may be less accurate for black people, as was the case in the development of an AI-based [pulse oximeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry \"Pulse oximetry\") that overestimated blood oxygen levels in patients with darker skin, causing issues with their [hypoxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medicine) \"Hypoxia (medicine)\") treatment.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-72) Oftentimes the systems are able to easily detect the faces of white people while being unable to register the faces of people who are black. This has led to the ban of police usage of AI materials or software in some [U.S. states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._states \"U.S. states\"). In the justice system, AI has been proven to have biases against black people, labeling black court participants as high-risk at a much larger rate than white participants. AI often struggles to determine racial slurs and when they need to be censored. It struggles to determine when certain words are being used as a slur and when it is being used culturally.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Spindler-20232-73) The reason for these biases is that AI pulls information from across the internet to influence its responses in each situation. For example, if a facial recognition system was only tested on people who were white, it would make it much harder for it to interpret the facial structure and tones of other races and [ethnicities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity \"Ethnicity\"). Biases often stem from the training data rather than the [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm \"Algorithm\") itself, notably when the data represents past human decisions.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-74)\\n\\n[Injustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice \"Injustice\") in the use of AI is much harder to eliminate within healthcare systems, as oftentimes diseases and conditions can affect different races and genders differently. This can lead to confusion as the AI may be making decisions based on statistics showing that one patient is more likely to have problems due to their gender or race.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-75) This can be perceived as a bias because each patient is a different case, and AI is making decisions based on what it is programmed to group that individual into. This leads to a discussion about what should be considered a biased decision in the distribution of treatment. While it is known that there are differences in how diseases and injuries affect different genders and races, there is a discussion on whether it is fairer to incorporate this into healthcare treatments, or to examine each patient without this knowledge. In modern society there are certain tests for diseases, such as [breast cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer \"Breast cancer\"), that are recommended to certain groups of people over others because they are more likely to contract the disease in question. If AI implements these statistics and applies them to each patient, it could be considered biased.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-76)\\n\\nIn criminal justice, the [COMPAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software) \"COMPAS (software)\") program has been used to predict which defendants are more likely to reoffend. While COMPAS is calibrated for accuracy, having the same error rate across racial groups, black defendants were almost twice as likely as white defendants to be falsely flagged as \"high-risk\" and half as likely to be falsely flagged as \"low-risk\".[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-77) Another example is within Google\\'s ads that targeted men with higher paying jobs and women with lower paying jobs. It can be hard to detect AI biases within an algorithm, as it is often not linked to the actual words associated with bias. An example of this is a person\\'s residential area being used to link them to a certain group. This can lead to problems, as oftentimes businesses can avoid legal action through this loophole.

The company argued that community platforms powering large language models \"absolutely should be compensated\" so they can reinvest in sustaining [open knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge \"Open knowledge\"). Stack Overflow said its data was being accessed through [scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping \"Data scraping\"), APIs, and data dumps, often without proper attribution, in violation of its terms and the [Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license \"Creative Commons license\") applied to user contributions.

Since early 2024, bandwidth usage had increased by 50 percent due to large-scale downloading of multimedia content by bots collecting training data for AI models. These bots often accessed obscure and less-frequently cached pages, bypassing caching systems and imposing high costs on core data centers. According to Wikimedia, bots made up 35 percent of total page views but accounted for 65 percent of the most expensive requests. The Foundation noted that \"our content is free, our infrastructure is not\" and warned that \"this creates a technical imbalance that threatens the sustainability of community-run platforms\".[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-106)\\n\\n### Transparency\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=22 \"Edit section: Transparency\")]\\n\\nApproaches like machine learning with [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network \"Neural network\") can result in computers making decisions that neither they nor their developers can explain. It is difficult for people to determine if such decisions are fair and trustworthy, leading potentially to bias in AI systems going undetected, or people rejecting the use of such systems. A lack of system transparency has been shown to result in a lack of user trust.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-107) Consequently, many standards and policies have been proposed to compel developers of AI systems to incorporate transparency into their systems.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-108) This push for transparency has led to advocacy and in some jurisdictions legal requirements for [explainable artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence \"Explainable artificial intelligence\").[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-109) Explainable artificial intelligence encompasses both explainability and interpretability, with explainability relating to providing reasons for the model\\'s outputs, and interpretability focusing on understanding the inner workings of an AI model.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-110)\\n\\nIn healthcare, the use of complex AI methods or techniques often results in models described as \"[black-boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box \"Black box\")\" due to the difficulty to understand how they work. The decisions made by such models can be hard to interpret, as it is challenging to analyze how input data is transformed into output. This lack of transparency is a significant concern in fields like healthcare, where understanding the rationale behind decisions can be crucial for trust, ethical considerations, and compliance with regulatory standards.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-111) Trust in healthcare AI has been shown to vary depending on the level of transparency provided.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-112) Moreover, unexplainable outputs of AI systems make it much more difficult to identify and detect medical error.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-113)\\n\\n### Accountability\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=23 \"Edit section: Accountability\")]\\n\\nA special case of the opaqueness of AI is that caused by it being [anthropomorphised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphised \"Anthropomorphised\"), that is, assumed to have human-like characteristics, resulting in misplaced conceptions of its [moral agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_agency \"Moral agency\").[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy\\\\_dispute#Disputed\\\\_statement \"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ethics\\\\_of\\\\_artificial\\\\_intelligence#Dubious \"Talk:Ethics of artificial intelligence\")_] This can cause people to overlook whether either human [negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence \"Negligence\") or deliberate criminal action has led to unethical outcomes produced through an AI system.

Events such as [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 \"COVID-19\") have sped up the adoption of AI programs in the application process, due to more people having to apply electronically, and with this increase in online applicants the use of AI made the process of narrowing down potential employees easier and more efficient. AI has become more prominent as businesses have to keep up with the times and ever-expanding internet. Processing analytics and making decisions becomes much easier with the help of AI.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Spindler-20232-73) As [Tensor Processing Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit \"Tensor Processing Unit\") (TPUs) and [graphics processing units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit \"Graphics processing unit\") (GPUs) become more powerful, AI capabilities also increase, forcing companies to use it to keep up with the competition. Managing customers\\' needs and automating many parts of the workplace leads to companies having to spend less money on employees.\\n\\nAI has also seen increased usage in criminal justice and healthcare. For medicinal means, AI is being used more often to analyze patient data to make predictions about future patients\\' conditions and possible treatments. These programs are called [clinical decision support systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_decision_support_system \"Clinical decision support system\") (DSS). AI\\'s future in healthcare may develop into something further than just recommended treatments, such as referring certain patients over others, leading to the possibility of inequalities.[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-126)\\n\\n### AI welfare\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=26 \"Edit section: AI welfare\")]\\n\\nIn 2020, professor Shimon Edelman noted that only a small portion of work in the rapidly growing field of AI ethics addressed the possibility of AIs experiencing suffering. This was despite credible theories having outlined possible ways by which AI systems may become conscious, such as the [global workspace theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory \"Global workspace theory\") or the [integrated information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory \"Integrated information theory\"). Edelman notes one exception had been [Thomas Metzinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Metzinger \"Thomas Metzinger\"), who in 2018 called for a global moratorium on further work that risked creating conscious AIs. The moratorium was to run to 2050 and could be either extended or repealed early, depending on progress in better understanding the risks and how to mitigate them. Metzinger repeated this argument in 2021, highlighting the risk of creating an \"[explosion of artificial suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering_risks \"Suffering risks\")\", both as an AI might suffer in intense ways that humans could not understand, and as replication processes may see the creation of huge quantities of conscious instances.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Metzinger2-127)[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Edelman2-128) Podcast host Dwarkesh Patel said he cared about making sure no \"digital equivalent of [factory farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming \"Factory farming\")\" happens.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:22-129) In the [ethics of uncertain sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_uncertain_sentience \"Ethics of uncertain sentience\"), the [precautionary principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle \"Precautionary principle\") is often invoked.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-130)\\n\\nSeveral labs have openly stated they are trying to create conscious AIs.

One reason for this is that digital hardware could enable much faster information processing than biological brains, leading to a faster rate of [subjective experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_experience \"Subjective experience\").

If machines replace them, we will find ourselves alienated, devalued and frustrated, for the artificially intelligent system would not be able to simulate empathy. Artificial intelligence, if used in this way, represents a threat to human dignity.

In this case, the automated car was capable of detecting cars and certain obstacles in order to autonomously navigate the roadway, but it could not anticipate a pedestrian in the middle of the road.

They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard.[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-222) They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence\". They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-NYT-2009-169)\\n\\nAlso in 2009, during an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of [Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne \"Lausanne\"), Switzerland, robots that were programmed to cooperate with each other (in searching out a beneficial resource and avoiding a poisonous one) eventually learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource.[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-223)\\n\\nRole and impact of fiction\\n--------------------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=38 \"Edit section: Role and impact of fiction\")]\\n\\nMain article: [Artificial intelligence in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction \"Artificial intelligence in fiction\")\\n\\nThe role of fiction with regards to AI ethics has been a complex one.[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Bassett-224) One can distinguish three levels at which fiction has impacted the development of artificial intelligence and robotics: Historically, fiction has prefigured common tropes that have not only influenced goals and visions for AI, but also outlined ethical questions and common fears associated with it. During the second half of the twentieth and the first decades of the twenty-first century, popular culture, in particular movies, TV series and video games have frequently echoed preoccupations and dystopian projections around ethical questions concerning AI and robotics. Recently, these themes have also been increasingly treated in literature beyond the realm of science fiction. And, as Carme Torras, research professor at the _Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial_ (Institute of robotics and industrial computing) at the Technical University of Catalonia notes,[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-225) in higher education, science fiction is also increasingly used for teaching technology-related ethical issues in technological degrees.\\n\\n### TV series\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=39 \"Edit section: TV series\")]\\n\\nWhile ethical questions linked to AI have been featured in science fiction literature and [feature films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_intelligence_films \"List of artificial intelligence films\") for decades, the emergence of the TV series as a genre allowing for longer and more complex story lines and character development has led to some significant contributions that deal with ethical implications of technology. The Swedish series _[Real Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real\\\\_Humans \"Real Humans\")_ (2012–2013) tackled the complex ethical and social consequences linked to the integration of artificial sentient beings in society. The British dystopian science fiction anthology series _[Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\\\\_Mirror \"Black Mirror\")_ (2013–Present) is particularly notable for experimenting with dystopian fictional developments linked to a wide variety of recent technology developments. Both the French series [_Osmosis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis_(TV_series) \"Osmosis (TV series)\") (2020) and British series [_The One_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_(TV_series) \"The One (TV series)\") deal with the question of what can happen if technology tries to find the ideal partner for a person. Several episodes of the Netflix series [_Love, Death+Robots_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Death_%26_Robots \"Love, Death & Robots\") have imagined scenes of robots and humans living together. The most representative one of them is S02 E01, which shows how bad the consequences can be when robots get out of control if humans rely too much on them in their lives.[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-226)\\n\\n### Future visions in fiction and games\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence&action=edit&section=40 \"Edit section: Future visions in fiction and games\")]\\n\\nThe movie _[The Thirteenth Floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Thirteenth\\\\_Floor \"The Thirteenth Floor\")_ suggests a future where [simulated worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality \"Simulated reality\") with sentient inhabitants are created by computer [game consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_console \"Game console\") for the purpose of entertainment. The movie _[The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Matrix \"The Matrix\")_ suggests a future where the dominant species on planet Earth are sentient machines and humanity is treated with utmost [speciesism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism \"Speciesism\"). The short story \"[The Planck Dive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planck_Dive \"The Planck Dive\")\" suggests a future where humanity has turned itself into software that can be duplicated and optimized and the relevant distinction between types of software is sentient and non-sentient. The same idea can be found in the [Emergency Medical Hologram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Hologram \"Emergency Medical Hologram\") of _[Starship Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS\\\\_Voyager\\\\_(NCC-74656) \"USS Voyager (NCC-74656)\")_, which is an apparently sentient copy of a reduced subset of the consciousness of its creator, [Dr. Zimmerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Zimmerman \"Lewis Zimmerman\"), who, for the best motives, has created the system to give medical assistance in case of emergencies. The movies _[Bicentennial Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial\\\\_Man\\\\_(film) \"Bicentennial Man (film)\")_ and _[A.I.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I.\\\\_Artificial\\\\_Intelligence \"A.I.

The group first met on July 5, 1967, on the campus of [Ohio State University](/wiki/Ohio_State_University \"Ohio State University\") to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization[[6]](#cite_note-In_the_beginning-6) and hired [Frederick G. Kilgour](/wiki/Frederick_G._Kilgour \"Frederick G. Kilgour\"), a former [Yale University](/wiki/Yale_University \"Yale University\") medical school librarian, as first executive director.[[7]](#cite_note-tech-7)[[8]](#cite_note-Kilgour1987-8)\\n\\nKilgour and Ralph H. Parker, who was the head of libraries at the [University of Missouri](/wiki/University_of_Missouri \"University of Missouri\"), had proposed the shared cataloging system in a 1965 report as consultants to the Committee of Librarians of the Ohio College Association.[[8]](#cite_note-Kilgour1987-8) Kilgour and Parker wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library.[[8]](#cite_note-Kilgour1987-8) They were inspired in part by the earlier Columbia–Harvard–Yale Medical Libraries Computerization Project, an attempt at shared automated printing of catalog cards.[[8]](#cite_note-Kilgour1987-8) The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management, bringing libraries together cooperatively to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the [Alden Library](/wiki/Alden_Library \"Alden Library\") at [Ohio University](/wiki/Ohio_University \"Ohio University\") on August 26, 1971. This was the first online cataloging by any library worldwide.[[6]](#cite_note-In_the_beginning-6)\\n\\nBetween 1967 and 1977, OCLC membership was limited to institutions in Ohio, but in 1978, a new governance structure was established that allowed institutions from other states to join. With this expansion, the name changed to the Online Computer Library Center in 1977.[[9]](#cite_note-9) In 2002, the governance structure was again modified to accommodate participation from outside the United States.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\\n\\nAs OCLC expanded services in the United States outside Ohio, it relied on establishing strategic partnerships with \"networks\", organizations that provided training, support and marketing services. By 2008, there were 15 independent United States regional service providers. OCLC networks played a key role in OCLC governance, with networks electing delegates to serve on the OCLC Members Council. During 2008, OCLC commissioned two studies to look at distribution channels; at the same time, the council approved governance changes that had been recommended by the Board of Trustees severing the tie between the networks and governance. In early 2009, OCLC negotiated new contracts with the former networks and opened a centralized support center.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\\n\\nIn July 2010, the company was sued by SkyRiver, a rival startup, in an [antitrust suit](/wiki/Competition_law \"Competition law\").[[12]](#cite_note-kc.201007-12) Library automation company [Innovative Interfaces](/wiki/Innovative_Interfaces \"Innovative Interfaces\") joined SkyRiver in the suit.[[13]](#cite_note-lj.264-13) The suit was dropped in March 2013, however, following the acquisition of SkyRiver by Innovative Interfaces.[[14]](#cite_note-id.20130304-14)\\nInnovative Interfaces was bought by [ExLibris](/wiki/ExLibris \"ExLibris\") in 2020, therefore passing OCLC as the dominant supplier of [ILS](/wiki/Integrated_library_system \"Integrated library system\") services in the U.S. (over 70% market share for academic libraries and over 50% for public libraries for ExLibris, versus OCLC\\'s 10% market share of both types of libraries in 2019).[[15]](#cite_note-15)\\n\\nIn 2022, membership and governance expanded to include any institution with a subscription to one of many qualifying OCLC products (previously institutions qualified for membership by \"contributing intellectual content or participating in global resource or reference sharing\"), with the exception of for-profit organizations that are part of OCLC\\'s partner program.[[16]](#cite_note-member-protocols-16) This change reflected OCLC\\'s expanding number of services due to its [corporate acquisitions](/wiki/Corporate_acquisition \"Corporate acquisition\").[[16]](#cite_note-member-protocols-16)\\n\\n### Presidents\\n\\nThe following people served successively as president of OCLC:[[17]](#cite_note-17)\\n\\n## Services\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/OCLC_Online_Computer_Library_Center_aerial_view_-_DPLA_-_f77302059c9901bd7622272437e9f8d6.jpg/250px-OCLC_Online_Computer_Library_Center_aerial_view_-_DPLA_-_f77302059c9901bd7622272437e9f8d6.jpg)\\n\\nOCLC provides [bibliographic](/wiki/Bibliographic \"Bibliographic\"), [abstract](/wiki/Abstract_(summary) \"Abstract (summary)\") and full-text information to anyone.\\n\\nOCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain [WorldCat](/wiki/WorldCat \"WorldCat\")—the OCLC Online Union Catalog, the largest [online public access catalog](/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog \"Online public access catalog\") (OPAC) in the world.[[5]](#cite_note-largest-5) WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide.\\n\\nThe Online Computer Library Center acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the [Dewey Decimal Classification](/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification \"Dewey Decimal Classification\") System when it bought Forest Press in 1988. A browser[[18]](#cite_note-oclc.dewey-18) for books with their Dewey Decimal Classifications was available until July 2013; it was replaced by the Classify Service.\\n\\nUntil August 2009, when it was sold to Backstage Library Works, OCLC owned a preservation microfilm and [digitization](/wiki/Digitization \"Digitization\") operation called the OCLC Preservation Service Center,[[19]](#cite_note-oclc-p-19) with its principal office in [Bethlehem, Pennsylvania](/wiki/Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania \"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania\").\\n\\nStarting in 1971, OCLC produced [catalog cards](/wiki/Catalog_card \"Catalog card\") for members alongside its shared online catalog; the company printed its last catalog cards on October 1, 2015.[[20]](#cite_note-20)\\n\\n**QuestionPoint**,[[21]](#cite_note-oclc.questionpoint-21) an around-the-clock reference service provided to users by a cooperative of participating global libraries, was acquired by [Springshare](/w/index.php?title=Springshare&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Springshare (page does not exist)\") from OCLC in 2019 and migrated to Springshare\\'s LibAnswers platform.[[22]](#cite_note-22)[[23]](#cite_note-23)\\n\\n## Software\\n\\nOCLC commercially sells software, such as:\\n\\n## Research\\n\\nOCLC has been conducting research for the library community for more than 30 years. In accordance with its mission, OCLC makes its research outcomes known through various publications.[[34]](#cite_note-oclc.res-34) These publications, including journal articles, reports, newsletters, and presentations, are available through the organization\\'s website.\\n\\nDuring the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic \"COVID-19 pandemic\"), OCLC participated in the REopening Archives, Libraries, and Museums (REALM) project funded by the [IMLS](/wiki/Institute_of_Museum_and_Library_Services \"Institute of Museum and Library Services\") to study the surface transmission risks of [SARS-CoV-2](/wiki/SARS-CoV-2 \"SARS-CoV-2\") on common library and museum materials and surfaces,[[39]](#cite_note-39) and published a series of reports.[[40]](#cite_note-40)\\n\\n## Advocacy\\n\\nAdvocacy has been a part of OCLC\\'s mission since its founding in 1967. OCLC staff members meet and work regularly with library leaders, information professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs, political leaders, trustees, students and patrons to advocate \"advancing research, scholarship, education, community development, information access, and global cooperation\".[[41]](#cite_note-De_Rosa_2009_719–726-41)[[42]](#cite_note-TheG2009-42)\\n\\nWebJunction, which provides training services to librarians,[[43]](#cite_note-oclc.webjunction-43) is a division of OCLC funded by grants from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation \"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\") beginning in 2003.[[44]](#cite_note-44)[[45]](#cite_note-45)\\n\\nOCLC partnered with search engine providers in 2003 to advocate for libraries and share information across the Internet landscape. Google, [Yahoo!](/wiki/Yahoo! \"Yahoo!\"), and [Ask.com](/wiki/Ask.com \"Ask.com\") all collaborated with OCLC to make WorldCat records searchable through those search engines.[[41]](#cite_note-De_Rosa_2009_719–726-41)\\n\\nOCLC\\'s advocacy campaign \"Geek the Library\", started in 2009, highlights the role of public libraries. The campaign, funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, uses a strategy based on the findings of the 2008 OCLC report, \"From Awareness to Funding: A study of library support in America\".[[46]](#cite_note-advocacy-46)\\n\\nOther past advocacy campaigns have focused on sharing the knowledge gained from library and information research. Such projects have included communities such as the [Society of American Archivists](/wiki/Society_of_American_Archivists \"Society of American Archivists\"), the [Open Archives Initiative](/wiki/Open_Archives_Initiative \"Open Archives Initiative\"), the [Institute for Museum and Library Services](/wiki/Institute_for_Museum_and_Library_Services \"Institute for Museum and Library Services\"), the [International Organization for Standardization](/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization \"International Organization for Standardization\"), the [National Information Standards Organization](/wiki/National_Information_Standards_Organization \"National Information Standards Organization\"), the [World Wide Web Consortium](/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium \"World Wide Web Consortium\"), the [Internet Engineering Task Force](/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force \"Internet Engineering Task Force\"), and [Internet2](/wiki/Internet2 \"Internet2\"). One of the most successful contributions to this effort was the [Dublin Core](/wiki/Dublin_Core \"Dublin Core\") Metadata Initiative, \"an open forum of libraries, archives, museums, technology organizations, and software companies who work together to develop interoperable online [metadata standards](/wiki/Metadata_standards \"Metadata standards\") that support a broad range of purposes and business models.\"[[41]](#cite_note-De_Rosa_2009_719–726-41)\\n\\nOCLC has collaborated with the [Wikimedia Foundation](/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation \"Wikimedia Foundation\") and the Wikimedia volunteer community, through integrating library metadata with Wikimedia projects, hosting a [Wikipedian in residence](/wiki/Wikipedian_in_residence \"Wikipedian in residence\"), and doing a national training program through WebJunction called \"Wikipedia + Libraries: Better Together\".[[47]](#cite_note-Libraries_Leverage_Wikimedia-47)[[48]](#cite_note-48)[[49]](#cite_note-49)\\n\\n## Online database: WorldCat\\n\\nOCLC\\'s WorldCat database is used by the general public and by librarians for cataloging and research. WorldCat is available to the public for searching via a subscription web-based service called FirstSearch, to which many libraries subscribe,[[50]](#cite_note-firstsearch-50) as well as through the publicly available WorldCat.org.[[51]](#cite_note-51)\\n\\n## Identifiers and linked data\\n\\nOCLC assigns a unique [accession number](/wiki/Accession_number_(cultural_property) \"Accession number (cultural property)\") referred to as an \"OCN\", an \"OCLC Control Number\" or an \"OCLC number\" to each new bibliographic record in WorldCat. This is somewhat analogous to how the [Library of Congress](/wiki/Library_of_Congress \"Library of Congress\") assigns an \"LCCN\" or a \"[Library of Congress Control Number](/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number \"Library of Congress Control Number\")\" to its bibliographic records (but LCCNs can be prefixed and are thus extended to other uses too like [authority control](/wiki/Authority_control \"Authority control\"), etc.). Numbers are assigned serially, and in mid-2013 over a billion OCNs had been created. In September 2013, OCLC declared these numbers to be in the [public domain](/wiki/Public_domain \"Public domain\"), removing a perceived barrier to widespread use of OCNs outside OCLC itself.[[52]](#cite_note-oclc.public-52) The control numbers link WorldCat\\'s records to local library system records by providing a common reference key for a record in libraries.[[53]](#cite_note-oclc.control-53)\\n\\nOCNs are particularly useful as [identifiers](/wiki/Identifier \"Identifier\") for books and other bibliographic materials that do not have [ISBNs](/wiki/ISBN \"ISBN\") (e.g., books published before 1970). OCNs are often used as identifiers for Wikipedia and [Wikidata](/wiki/Wikidata \"Wikidata\"). In October 2013, it was reported that out of 29,673 instances of book [infoboxes](/wiki/Infobox \"Infobox\") in Wikipedia, \"there were 23,304 ISBNs and 15,226 OCNs\", and regarding Wikidata: \"of around 14 million Wikidata items, 28,741 were books. 5,403 Wikidata items have an ISBN associated with them and 12,262 have OCNs.\"[[54]](#cite_note-oclc.wild-54)\\n\\nOCLC also runs the [Virtual International Authority File](/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File \"Virtual International Authority File\") (VIAF), an international name authority file, with oversight from the VIAF Council composed of representatives of institutions that contribute data to VIAF.[[55]](#cite_note-55) VIAF numbers are broadly used as standard identifiers, including in Wikipedia.[[47]](#cite_note-Libraries_Leverage_Wikimedia-47)[[56]](#cite_note-56)\\n\\nIn 2024, OCLC launched a new linked data management tool called OCLC Meridian.[[57]](#cite_note-57) This was released with a suite of [APIs](/wiki/API \"API\") for WorldCat Entities to allow greater control, connection and integration of linked data for user institutions. This suite of APIs \"enables the creation of linked data entities and descriptive relationships, forming connections to the existing value in [MARC records](/wiki/MARC_standards \"MARC standards\") and other datasets across the global information ecosystem\".[[33]](#cite_note-Meridian-33) The use of these APIs and WorldCat Entities is designed to \"improve discoverability and relevance for users\", \"integrate data management into your existing workflows\" and \"discover, emphasize and analyze important relationships\".[[33]](#cite_note-Meridian-33) A set of WorldCat Entities APIs \"enables users to connect identifiers from disparate sources (such as [ORCID](/wiki/ORCID \"ORCID\"), [ISNI](/wiki/ISNI \"ISNI\"), VIAF, etc.), learn of changes to WorldCat Entities data\" and related information for local use.[[33]](#cite_note-Meridian-33)\\n\\n## Company acquisitions\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Schipholweg_99%2C_Leiden.JPG/500px-Schipholweg_99%2C_Leiden.JPG)\\n\\nOCLC acquired [NetLibrary](/wiki/NetLibrary \"NetLibrary\"), a provider of electronic books and textbooks, in 2002 and sold it in 2010 to [EBSCO Industries](/wiki/EBSCO_Industries \"EBSCO Industries\").[[58]](#cite_note-oclc.2010-58) OCLC owns 100% of the shares of [OCLC PICA](/wiki/OCLC_PICA \"OCLC PICA\"), a [library automation systems](/wiki/Library_automation_system \"Library automation system\") and services company which has its headquarters in [Leiden](/wiki/Leiden \"Leiden\") in the Netherlands and which was renamed \"OCLC\" at the end of 2007.[[59]](#cite_note-lj.ca6495514-59) In July 2006, the [Research Libraries Group](/wiki/Research_Libraries_Group \"Research Libraries Group\") (RLG) merged with OCLC.[[60]](#cite_note-Wilson-60)[[61]](#cite_note-61)\\n\\nOn January 11, 2008, OCLC announced[[62]](#cite_note-oclc.200690-62) that it had purchased [EZproxy](/wiki/EZproxy \"EZproxy\"). It has also acquired [OAIster](/wiki/OAIster \"OAIster\"). The process started in January 2009 and from October 31, 2009, OAIster records are freely available via WorldCat.org.\\n\\nIn 2013, OCLC acquired the Dutch library automation company HKA[[63]](#cite_note-63)[[64]](#cite_note-64) and its [integrated library system](/wiki/Integrated_library_system \"Integrated library system\") Wise,[[28]](#cite_note-InfoTodayWise-28) which OCLC calls a \"community engagement system\" that \"combines the power of customer relationship management, marketing, and analytics with ILS functions\".[[27]](#cite_note-OCLCWise-27) OCLC began offering Wise to libraries in the United States in 2019.[[28]](#cite_note-InfoTodayWise-28)\\n\\nIn January 2015, OCLC acquired Sustainable Collection Services (SCS). SCS offered consulting services based on analyzing library print collection data to help libraries manage and share materials.[[65]](#cite_note-65) In 2017, OCLC acquired Relais International, a library interlibrary loan service provider based in Ottawa, Canada.[[66]](#cite_note-66)\\n\\nA more complete list of mergers and acquisitions is available on the OCLC website.[[67]](#cite_note-67)\\n\\n## Criticism\\n\\nIn May 2008, OCLC was criticized by [Jeffrey Beall](/wiki/Jeffrey_Beall \"Jeffrey Beall\") for [monopolistic](/wiki/Monopolistic \"Monopolistic\") practices, among other faults.[[68]](#cite_note-oclc.2008-68) Library blogger Rick Mason responded that although he thought Beall had some \"valid criticisms\" of OCLC, he demurred from some of Beall\\'s statements and warned readers to \"beware the hyperbole and the personal nature of his criticism, for they strongly overshadow that which is worth stating\".[[69]](#cite_note-69)\\n\\nIn November 2008, the Board of Directors of OCLC unilaterally issued a new Policy for Use and Transfer of WorldCat Records[[70]](#cite_note-70) that would have required member libraries to include an OCLC policy note on their [bibliographic records](/wiki/Bibliographic_record \"Bibliographic record\"); the policy caused an uproar among librarian bloggers.[[71]](#cite_note-71)[[72]](#cite_note-McKenzie-72) Among those who protested the policy was the non-librarian activist [Aaron Swartz](/wiki/Aaron_Swartz \"Aaron Swartz\"), who believed the policy would threaten projects such as the [Open Library](/wiki/Open_Library \"Open Library\"), [Zotero](/wiki/Zotero \"Zotero\"), and Wikipedia, and who started a petition to \"Stop the OCLC powergrab\".[[73]](#cite_note-73)[[74]](#cite_note-watchdog.net-74) Swartz\\'s petition garnered 858 signatures, but the details of his proposed actions went largely unheeded.[[72]](#cite_note-McKenzie-72) Within a few months, the library community had forced OCLC to retract its policy and to create a Review Board to consult with member libraries more transparently.[[72]](#cite_note-McKenzie-72) In August 2012, OCLC recommended that member libraries adopt the [Open Data Commons](/wiki/Open_Data_Commons \"Open Data Commons\") Attribution (ODC-BY) license when sharing library catalog data, although some member libraries have explicit agreements with OCLC that they can publish catalog data using the [CC0](/wiki/CC0 \"CC0\") Public Domain Dedication.[[75]](#cite_note-75)[[76]](#cite_note-76)\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n## References\\n\\n## Further reading\\n\\n## External links\\n\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png)\\n![Edit this at Wikidata](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png)\\n![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=mobile&type=1x1&usesul3=1)\\n\\n#### Languages\\n\\n![Wikipedia](/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg)\\n\\n* [![Wikimedia Foundation](/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg)](https://www.wikimedia.org/)\\n* [![Powered by MediaWiki](/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg)](https://www.mediawiki.org/)\\n\\n![Wikimedia Foundation](/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg)\\n![Powered by MediaWiki](/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg)'},\n",

ISSNs are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.[[2]](#cite_note-2)\\n\\nThe ISSN system was first drafted as an [International Organization for Standardization](/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization \"International Organization for Standardization\") (ISO) [international standard](/wiki/International_standard \"International standard\") in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975.[[3]](#cite_note-3) ISO subcommittee [TC 46/SC 9](/wiki/TC_46/SC_9 \"TC 46/SC 9\") is responsible for maintaining the standard.\\n\\nWhen a serial with the same [content](/wiki/Content_(media) \"Content (media)\") is published in more than one [media type](/wiki/Media_(communication) \"Media (communication)\"), a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in [print](/wiki/Printing \"Printing\") and [electronic media](/wiki/Electronic_media \"Electronic media\"). The ISSN system refers to these types as **print ISSN** (**p-ISSN**) and **electronic ISSN** (**e-ISSN**).[[4]](#cite_note-4) Consequently, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a **linking ISSN** (**ISSN-L**), typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium.[[5]](#cite_note-5)\\n\\n## Code format\\n\\nAn ISSN is an eight-digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.[[1]](#cite_note-Whatis-1) The last digit, which may be zero through nine or an X, is a [check digit](/wiki/Check_digit \"Check digit\"), so the ISSN is uniquely represented by its first seven digits. Formally, the general form of the ISSN (also named \"ISSN structure\" or \"ISSN syntax\") can be expressed as follows:[[6]](#cite_note-rfc3044-6)\\n\\n`NNNN-NNNC`\\n\\nwhere `N` is in the set {*0,1,2,...,9*}, a decimal digit character, and `C` is in {*0,1,2,...,9,X*}; or by a [Perl Compatible Regular Expressions](/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions \"Perl Compatible Regular Expressions\") (PCRE) [regular expression](/wiki/Regular_expression \"Regular expression\"):\\n\\n`N`\\n`C`\\n`^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}[0-9X]$`\\n\\nFor example, the ISSN of the journal *[Hearing Research](/wiki/Hearing_Research \"Hearing Research\")*, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that is `C`=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used:\\n\\n`C`\\n\\n0\\n⋅\\n8\\n+\\n3\\n⋅\\n7\\n+\\n7\\n⋅\\n6\\n+\\n8\\n⋅\\n5\\n+\\n5\\n⋅\\n4\\n+\\n9\\n⋅\\n3\\n+\\n5\\n⋅\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n0\\n+\\n21\\n+\\n42\\n+\\n40\\n+\\n20\\n+\\n27\\n+\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n160\\n\\n.\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}&0\\\\cdot 8+3\\\\cdot 7+7\\\\cdot 6+8\\\\cdot 5+5\\\\cdot 4+9\\\\cdot 3+5\\\\cdot 2\\\\\\\\&=0+21+42+40+20+27+10\\\\\\\\&=160\\\\;.\\\\end{aligned}}}\\n![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}&0\\\\cdot 8+3\\\\cdot 7+7\\\\cdot 6+8\\\\cdot 5+5\\\\cdot 4+9\\\\cdot 3+5\\\\cdot 2\\\\\\\\&=0+21+42+40+20+27+10\\\\\\\\&=160\\\\;.\\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a413195e95f6e5787852022cac196f5594b2a9e7)\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}&0\\\\cdot 8+3\\\\cdot 7+7\\\\cdot 6+8\\\\cdot 5+5\\\\cdot 4+9\\\\cdot 3+5\\\\cdot 2\\\\\\\\&=0+21+42+40+20+27+10\\\\\\\\&=160\\\\;.\\\\end{aligned}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a413195e95f6e5787852022cac196f5594b2a9e7)\\n\\nThe [remainder](/wiki/Remainder \"Remainder\") of this sum [modulo](/wiki/Modulo \"Modulo\") 11 is then calculated:\\n\\n160\\n11\\n=\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\xa0remainder\\xa0\\n6\\n=\\n14\\n+\\n\\n\\n6\\n11\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {160}{11}}=14{\\\\mbox{ remainder }}6=14+{\\\\frac {6}{11}}}\\n![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {160}{11}}=14{\\\\mbox{ remainder }}6=14+{\\\\frac {6}{11}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10546bc3ccf2e421660938a3b52242c1e2485b42)\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {160}{11}}=14{\\\\mbox{ remainder }}6=14+{\\\\frac {6}{11}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/10546bc3ccf2e421660938a3b52242c1e2485b42)\\n\\nIf there is no remainder, the check digit is 0; otherwise the remainder is subtracted from 11. If the result is less than 10, it yields the check digit:\\n\\n11\\n−\\n6\\n=\\n5\\n\\n.\\n{\\\\displaystyle 11-6=5\\\\;.}\\n![{\\\\displaystyle 11-6=5\\\\;.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a300e4a478f863a5c8b04707ffa2af63ec82ab8d)\\nThus, in this example, the check digit `C` is 5.\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle 11-6=5\\\\;.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a300e4a478f863a5c8b04707ffa2af63ec82ab8d)\\n`C`\\n\\nTo confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by their position in the number, counting from the right. (If the check digit is X, add 10 to the sum.) The remainder of the sum modulo 11 must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]\\n\\n### In EANs\\n\\nISSNs can be encoded in [EAN-13 bar codes](/wiki/International_Article_Number_(EAN) \"International Article Number (EAN)\") with a 977 \"country code\" (compare the 978 \"[bookland](/wiki/Bookland \"Bookland\")\" country code for [ISBNs](/wiki/ISBN \"ISBN\")), followed by the 7 main digits of the ISSN (the check digit is not included), followed by 2 publisher-defined digits, followed by the EAN check digit (in most cases, this will not match the ISSN check digit, since they are each calculated in a different way).[[7]](#cite_note-7)\\n\\n## Code assignment, maintenance and look-up\\n\\nISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located at [national libraries](/wiki/National_library \"National library\") and coordinated by the **ISSN International Centre** (CIEPS[[8]](#cite_note-8)) based in [Paris](/wiki/Paris \"Paris\"). The International Centre is an [intergovernmental organization](/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization \"Intergovernmental organization\") created in 1974 through an agreement between [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO \"UNESCO\") and the French government.\\n\\n### Linking ISSN\\n\\n*ISSN-L* is a [unique identifier](/wiki/Unique_identifier \"Unique identifier\") for all versions of the serial containing the same [content](/wiki/Content_(media) \"Content (media)\") across different media. As defined by *ISO 3297:2007*, the \"linking ISSN (ISSN-L)\" provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource. The *ISSN-L* is one of a serial\\'s existing ISSNs, so does not change the use or assignment of \"ordinary\" ISSNs;[[9]](#cite_note-9) it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication. If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time, the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of the *ISSN-L*.\\n\\nWith *ISSN-L* is possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title. The use of *ISSN-L* facilitates search, retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like [OpenURL](/wiki/OpenURL \"OpenURL\"), [library catalogues](/wiki/Library_catalogue \"Library catalogue\"), [search engines](/wiki/Search_engine \"Search engine\") or [knowledge bases](/wiki/Knowledge_base \"Knowledge base\").\\n\\n### Register\\n\\nThe International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the *ISDS Register* (International Serials Data System), otherwise known as the *ISSN Register*. At the end of 2016,[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISSN&action=edit) the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items.[[10]](#cite_note-10) The Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web, but is available by subscription.\\n\\n`https://www.worldcat.org/ISSN/`\\n\\n## Comparison with other identifiers\\n\\nISSN and [ISBN](/wiki/ISBN \"ISBN\") codes are similar in concept, where ISBNs are assigned to individual [books](/wiki/Book \"Book\"). An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no [information](/wiki/Information \"Information\") as to the [publisher](/wiki/Publisher \"Publisher\") or its [location](/wiki/Location_(geography) \"Location (geography)\"). For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change.\\n\\n### Extensions\\n\\nSince the ISSN applies to an entire serial, other identifiers have been built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components (like the [table of contents](/wiki/Table_of_contents \"Table of contents\")): the [Publisher Item Identifier](/wiki/Publisher_Item_Identifier \"Publisher Item Identifier\") (PII) and the [Serial Item and Contribution Identifier](/wiki/Serial_Item_and_Contribution_Identifier \"Serial Item and Contribution Identifier\") (SICI).\\n\\n### Media versus content\\n\\nSeparate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media (except reproduction [microforms](/wiki/Microform \"Microform\")). Thus, the [print](/wiki/Print_media \"Print media\") and [electronic media](/wiki/Electronic_media \"Electronic media\") versions of a serial need separate ISSNs,[[11]](#cite_note-11) and [CD-ROM](/wiki/CD-ROM \"CD-ROM\") versions and [web](/wiki/World_Wide_Web \"World Wide Web\") versions require different ISSNs. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats (e.g. [PDF](/wiki/PDF \"PDF\") and [HTML](/wiki/HTML \"HTML\")) of the same online serial.\\n\\nThis \"media-oriented identification\" of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, and the Web, it makes sense to consider only *content*, independent of media. This \"content-oriented identification\" of serials was a [repressed demand](/wiki/Excess_demand \"Excess demand\") during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials\\' contents model arrived with the [indecs Content Model](/wiki/Indecs_Content_Model \"Indecs Content Model\") and its application, the [digital object identifier](/wiki/Digital_object_identifier \"Digital object identifier\") (DOI), an ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s.\\n\\nOnly later, in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the new ISSN standard (ISO 3297:2007) as an \"ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media\".[[12]](#cite_note-issnL-12)\\n\\n## Use in URNs\\n\\nAn ISSN can be encoded as a [uniform resource name](/wiki/Uniform_resource_name \"Uniform resource name\") (URN) by prefixing it with \"`urn:ISSN:`\".[[6]](#cite_note-rfc3044-6) For example, [*Rail*](/wiki/Rail_(magazine) \"Rail (magazine)\") could be referred to as \"`urn:ISSN:0953-4563`\". URN namespaces are case-sensitive, and the ISSN namespace is all caps.[[13]](#cite_note-13) If the checksum digit is \"X\" then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN.\\n\\n`urn:ISSN:`\\n`urn:ISSN:0953-4563`\\n\\n### Problems\\n\\nThe URNs are [content-oriented](#Media_versus_content), but ISSN is media-oriented:\\n\\n`https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13777`\\n`http://dx.issn.org/`\\n\\nA unique URN for serials simplifies the search, recovery and delivery of data for various services including, in particular, [search systems](/wiki/Information_retrieval \"Information retrieval\") and [knowledge databases](/wiki/Knowledge_base \"Knowledge base\").[[12]](#cite_note-issnL-12) **ISSN-L** (see [Linking ISSN](#Linking_ISSN) above) was created to fill this gap.\\n\\n## Media category labels\\n\\nThe two standard categories of media in which serials are most available are *print* and *electronic*. In [metadata](/wiki/Metadata \"Metadata\") contexts (e.g., [JATS](/wiki/JATS \"JATS\")), these may have standard labels.\\n\\n### Print ISSN\\n\\n*p-ISSN* is a standard label for \"Print ISSN\", the ISSN for the [print media](/wiki/Print_media \"Print media\") (paper) version of a serial. Usually it is the \"default media\" and so the \"default ISSN\".\\n\\n### Electronic ISSN\\n\\n*e-ISSN* (or *eISSN*) is a standard label for \"Electronic ISSN\", the ISSN for the [electronic media](/wiki/Electronic_media \"Electronic media\") (online) version of a serial.[[15]](#cite_note-15)\\n\\n## ROAD\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n## References\\n\\n## External
