# Web Search, Extraction, and Crawling using Tavily API

This repository is a **learning project** that demonstrates how to use the **Tavily API** in Python to enable AI applications or agents to access **real-time web data**.

The project focuses on three core capabilities:
- Web search with semantic understanding
- Content extraction from live web pages
- Crawling and mapping websites for comprehensive information

These capabilities are essential when building AI agents that require **up-to-date, accurate, and context-aware information** from the internet.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

Using a Jupyter Notebook, this project demonstrates:

1. **Web Search**
   - Perform semantic web searches
   - Retrieve the most relevant results
   - Filter results using parameters like time range, language, and region

2. **Content Extraction**
   - Extract clean and usable content from URLs
   - Retrieve raw page content for deeper analysis

3. **Web Crawling**
   - Crawl entire websites starting from a root URL
   - Collect linked pages and their content

4. **Website Mapping**
   - Map a website structure
   - Use natural language instructions to guide what information should be extracted

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tavily API**
- **tavily-python SDK**
- **python-dotenv** (for environment variable management)
